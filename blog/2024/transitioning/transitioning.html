I graduated my M.Eng in May, moved to San Francisco in July, and went on a trip to visit friends in New York and finish moving out from my Boston apartment. I miss college and the environment I was in for the past 5 years.</i></p>
                <h3>i. red-eye to boston (8/26/2024)</h3>
                <p>im back<br>and it feels like the SF part of my life was a fever dream and the Boston the reality, not the other way around<br>kinda crying rn lmao, yes it's 7am and nobody's anywhere, but the city gave me a warm welcome back and the charm of the red brick hasn't disappeared<br>actually everything feels surreal, but im touching the doorknob of the tech office and seeing it with my own eyes, so it must be real right<br>the work laptop is also real, but is so out of place it's so weird i feel like a time traveller / imposter version of myself / a movie where someone didn't do their research and put something from the future into a period piece</p>

                <p>story of my life<br>sitting in back bay for another hour because i missed my amtrak ðŸ¤¡<br>and wasted $120 because i bought a non-refundable ticket ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡</p>
                <p>after one scramble and missing an amtrak, arriving in new york<br>every time the train rolls into the city there's this energy of grandeur and chaos and everything and baDUMM<br>such is the cityest city mankind has ever city'd</p>

                <p>other people are doing it <span class="u-orange-text">[adulting]</span> why wouldn't i<p></p>and other people have it worse too<br>i just need to learn to be with myself but not my thoughts<br>and be in the sun<br>yeah this nyc trip is a different adult life simulator</p>
                <p>crowded crowded crowded ants ants ants</p>
                <p>just need to find myself regardless of friends<br>which is a bit anti me so have to rewire my brain a bit<br>be creative</p>

                <h3>iv. windows (8/28/2024)</h3>
                <p>window to the sun is a great window<br>also.. not being by <span class="u-orange-text">[sitting directly next to]</span> the co founders is great</p>
                <p>i love the A train</p>
                <p>the weird thing is: only my watch and laptop are set to pacific time, but it creates a pretty convincing portal and sometimes i do actually forget what time it actually is outside</p>
                <p>the discrepancy between the portal and the surroundings make it a bit hard to enjoy both realities</p>

                <h3>v. boston the comfort zone (8/28/2024)</h3>
                <p>boston remains my comfort zone<br>i get the same feeling when i get here as when i go home in bangkok<br>it's where i still feel belonging<br>but slowly i am coming to the reality<br>as i walk past groups of terrascope frosh 2028s<br>that im getting too old for this city<br>and time is kicking me out to uproot to san francisco</p>
                <p>i retrace the steps from kendall to my (old) apartment<br>some bits are changing, becoming a bit unfamiliar<br>like the outbound exit now white wall and attached to the google building<br>or the weeds growing taller<br>boston is not just a place, it was a time and a people<br>the apartment? only a shell of us, its former inhabitants, time is running out before the new tenants push us out</p>
                <p>i awkwardly pull the boston apartment keys from deep inside my wallet<br>thinking as i unlock it that im such an imposter now<br>the kitchen floor is redone<br>and the bathroom looks strange even though it looks the same<br>i still connect to the wifi immediately, but it's getting harder for me to connect with the house again</p>
                <p>why am i just pacing in the apartment</p>
                <p>old and crusty >>> new and fancy</p>

                <h3>vi. the college pace (8/29/2024)</h3>
                <p>lunch with <span class="u-orange-text">[a college friend]</span> reminds me of the college pace</p>
                <p><span class="u-orange-text">[i need to be]</span> happy being with myself</p>
                <p>you know another thing that i miss<br>is how young and diverse the environment feels, and that not everybody is doing tech</p>
                <p>the youthful energy and the diversity of knowledge and aspirations in the environment is so refreshing.. nobody's just building a startup or amassing money</p>

                <h3>vii. joy and energy (8/30/2024)</h3>
                <p>work, social, self: gotta find a good balance</p>
                <p>throwing mattresses is actually the most fun thing i've done in a while</p>
                <p>reuniting with the boston roommates!<br>it's so refreshing to be back and change up the environment</p>
                <p>going into stud post activities midway is something else<br>the ENERGY and the passion<br>maybe sf is just devoid of passion<br>and the proximity<br>just running into <span class="u-orange-text">[a college friend]</span> and a few other people is just a wonderful surprise</p>
                <p>i feel so split personality right now one im still working the other i want to enjoy boston</p>

                <p>wake up<br>reality is not here it's there<br>and i have to fight<br>for my work for social life and for myself</p>
                <p>it's my last night here<br>but im not overly sad or anything<br>maybe im starting to accept the fact that<br>i no longer should be here<br>my mind should no longer linger in this city<br>or maybe it's just<br>i will come back in three weeks</p>

                <p>alas<br>i'm back in san francisco<br>it only gets better from here I guess<br>it's incredibly sunny out here<br>but wow am i suddenly depressed<br>isn't that crazy<br>this city is the mundane<br>one track minded tech startup bros</p>
                <p>lol once i landed in sf<br>i immediately feel depressed<br>almost as if there's a conservation of clouds<br>boston has clouds in the sky<br>the overly bright sunny california weather puts clouds in my head</p>
