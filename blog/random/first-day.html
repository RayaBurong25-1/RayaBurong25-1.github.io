                <p>Fall 2020 is unlike no other. We're starting school in the middle of a pandemic, and I'm still at home, 11 hours ahead of the school's time zone. After daylight savings ends, that will become 12 hours. Anyway, I shaved some spare time today to document what this extraordinary first day of Fall 2020 is like and feels like. This will be a rather raw blog post.</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>Prelude</h2>
                    <p>My summer UROP reach its final day just last Friday, August 28, leaving me with three days (a long weekend) before today, the first day of class. I still have some bugs to fix, but I vowed to not touch the project during the well-deserved weekend. More details about the summer UROP, what I did should be coming either as a blog entry or as a project page sometime soon - I'll put a link [here]. Dormspam started kicking back in with a lot of club recruiting emails, MIT News Daily, course emails and more. Most of these club events happen around my sleep time, so that's a big L for myself and for everyone in this part of the world. Honestly I feel we're being forgotten or neglected, and that MIT as well as its occupants can do better to be aware of us poor people living literally on the other side of the world. ðŸ¥º</p>
                    <p>I spent the Saturday chilling, watching YouTube and Twitch, playing Duolingo, loading up free perks of MIT IS&T (if anyone doesn't know about the free Windows 10 license, Microsoft Office, Adobe CC account and many more, you're missing out!), playing with firehose and putting things on Google Calendar in preparation for the upcoming term, finally getting around to clearing all the emails sitting in my inbox for the past week or so, and geeking out and making progress on my <a href="../../projects/orthography/orthography.html">Project Orthography</a> big time.</p>
                    <p>Sunday I spent the day applying to techx, watching even more YouTube videos and making some progress on this very website. I'm aiming to refactor how I organize files (blog posts are still all dumped into one big folder right now), and fill in the much needed parts of my website to make it more full, say the project pages, the gallery and the profile pages. Not sure if this will actually happen though oops p r o c r a s t i n a t i o n</p>
                    <p>Monday a few friends <span class="highlight">darrenl</span> <span class="highlight">annasun</span> and <span class="highlight">stangs</span> called me during my breakfast as they reunited at an Airbnb in DC for the first half of the term. I wish I could go back to the US but *cough* scholarship organization heavily discourages it and things will become a big problem if I try to. I also went for an outing to meet with (most of) the class of '24 in Thailand and us class of '23, discuss classes, talk about random stuff, descend into corny inside jokes and never making up our minds to walk somewhere for hours. It was a great laugh and I also got a badminton racket out of it.</p>
                    <p>At night I looked into Canvas to see if there are any interesting updates to the classes I registered. A couple had questionnaires up, and being at the time zone that I am as well as being the frontloading boi that I am, I had to email both to talk about schedule conflicts and inconvenient class meeting times. This term classes are encouraged to have synchronous classes and interaction within them too.</p>

                    <h2>Slow start</h2>
                    <p>This morning I woke up at 9:30 am even though I've been trying to wake up earlier for the past many days. The morning routine went as usual: meeting my parents downstairs, eating breakfast oh so slowly, scrolling through all the social media apps on my phone, <i>then</i> taking a shower at like... noon.</p>
                    <p>I spent quite a while setting up my "notion.so," which is a Google Sheet I have been using since the Summer before Freshman year. I just don't want to spend extra time setting up notion.so, so I guess what worked continues to work. One thing I've noticed is that as MIT is emigrating from their Stellar + LMOD mess to Canvas, it's still quite a mess because some classes prefer their own website, some the Canvas, and some just won't let go of Stellar. I had to find Zoom links to each class as well as their main website and compile that together in my Sheet. One class even decided to use Piazza as "their main website"! What the heck.</p>

                    <h2>Lectures in 2x</h2>
                    <p>With my Google Sheet set and filled up with the schedule, the relevant links, the constant reminder to eventually drop two classes and/or put classes onto PE/NE or Sophomore Exploratory, and the first few psets, it's time to dive into the classes which already started posting material. One is 6.003 (Signal Processing) which we were tasked with viewing the first lecture asynchronously before we hop right into our first synchronous recitation. The lecture is only 25 minutes long, but I (for whatever reason) decided to play that on 2x. Perks of online learning, eh? I <b>will</b> be unfamiliar with the voice of the professor in 1x I'm sure.</p>
                    <p>Usually during lectures I write down notes in several fancy MUJI colors on blank pieces of A4/Letter paper and file them into folders of each class. As I'm doing this today (waiting for the loaner iPad that is not arriving until two weeks from today), I noticed that my handwriting has gone completely awful. It's almost as if for the past half year I haven't written anything on paper. Oh wait it actually is.</p>
                    <p>As I went through the lecture, I can't help but feel a bit lonesome in this venture. It's not quite the same as on campus where you walk into a lecture hall and spot people you know and establish the fact that we can depend on each other for the rest of the term. This time we only have interstellar and social media, and we have to actively search for other people to pset with. With that I went on to interstellar and discovered that I don't really know anyone taking the same classes as me either. Even among Thai MIT students my class, the other two have two classes in common while I don't have common classes with them. Aiya.</p>

                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>I also went ahead and read Reading 1 of 6.031 (Elements of Software Construction) as well, because frontloading is always good. I'm immensely thankful that I've learnt a bit of Java way back in high school and that I've meddled quite a bit with Android development for the past few years because that it probably will help me quite a bit this course. Feeling bad for those who started programming in Python, because Java is more nitpicky and has quite a lot more concepts, but feeling good for myself because I started from C++ which I think is as nitpicky if not more than Java. Off to a good start, perhaps? the List, ArrayList, final, static and data types totally make sense. F to all the pythoners who never had to care about data types.</p>
                    <p>With that, it was time for lunch.</p>

                    <h2>Recitation</h2>
                    <p>My first class of the year was a 6.003 recitation at 7pm. I had to shift my dinner time a bit because it usually is around that time too. By around 6:30pm, I started to get a bit nervous because I could not for the life of me find where the zoom link for the recitation would appear - yet another proof of how disorganized the whole thing is (or how bad I am at finding things).</p>
                    <p>The video call link was eventually posted some fifteen minutes before the recitation on the class website, and is actually on the class website with an embedded frame hosted on Jitsi Meet because idk, Zoom is monopolizing the market too much? I am greeted with the familiar sight of the instructor's screen and a small facecam on the corner, as well as the "bwuooop" jingle. Ah, we're really starting the term. Below the video call itself the 6.003 website provides a cute little live react bar as well as chat, so it feels a bit like Twitch here. There are also clicker questions that can be summoned during the call. The chat is also anonymous as well!</p>

                    <p>Adam Hartz started off with a corny joke and the usual COVID-19 spiel, but other than that it's a pretty standard virtual recitation session with a bit of technical issues here and there.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>Midnight Lecture</h2>
                    <p>There was then quite a long break between the 6.003 recitation and the next class tonight, which was 6.815 (Digital and Computational Photography). This class, as I've read so far, will be covering pretty much how to make Photoshop using C++, and other fun image manipulation stuff. I'm pretty stoked for this class and hopefully it's not too heavy because it's actually a <s>graduate level class</s>! edit: there is a graduate version of this class which means the version I'm taking is not graduate level. The class is about 50% seniors and only 5% sophomores (and no freshman), and overwhelmingly course 6.</p>
                    <p>During the down time, I watched some Twitch and worked in this very website, took a shower and went on my nightly routine of social media and Duolingo. I also set up some 6.031 software as advised by <span class="highlight">ashlin</span>, and joined a TS61xMIT voice chat while we wait for our next classes.</p>
                    <p>The introduction for 6.815 is <i>really interesting</i>! It is one of these classes that I'm really excited about (to be honest I'm quite excited about almost all the classes maybe except for 6.031 oops). As an avid photographer it'd be wild to <i>code</i> some of the functions I might otherwise see in Lightroom. Some example of psets we might do are HDR post-processing, focal change post-processing, and changing the lighting of a photo! Just... wow!</p>
                    <p>Points for this class being (semi) automatically graded using test cases and the grading for this class is 100% these psets - so it's essentially a partial feedback image programming contest or something ðŸ˜‚</p>
                    <p>More points for this class because the professor's cat keeps interrupting the lecture and as we all know cats = good.</p>
                    <p>Even more points for this class because we're (edit: optionally) going to be using a library developed by the professor himself, <a href="https://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a>. How crazy!</p>
                    <p>Apparently there's quite a lot of people in the class (there were like 64 in this first zoom meeting), and lectures are recorded, so I assume the class doesn't require attendance and maybe in the next lectures I'll sleep instead?</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>No 1:30am class please thanks</h2>
                    <p>24.902 is supposed to be synchronous, and has required attendance as well. I email the professor last night telling him that the class will become 1:30am to 3:00am my time (and shift that by an hour after daylight savings ends) and that I'd like some alternative way. Hopefully the asynchronous alternative will work, but if not, this is the first to go on my drop list.</p>

                    <p>That's the first day of Fall 2020! Let me now get some sleep and ponder whether this term will work out in the long run. I really do wish to go back to campus soon, and I know I'm repeating this again. Only a select few have gotten this unique experience of remote learning <i>on the other side of the world</i>, and it's pretty wild to imagine what it's like for those who haven't gone through this. It sometimes slips though people's minds and, even though they realize our situation, they might not <i>realize</i> our situation.</p>
