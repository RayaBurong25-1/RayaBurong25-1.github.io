                <p>This past Sunday I went into downtown Bangkok to play badminton with <span class="highlight">talkon</span>, <span class="highlight">taisf</span> and <span class="highlight">palmnak</span>. After that, we walked through the sois, encountered some closed gates we can't go through, and eventually called a taxi to get to a restaurant. We met up with <span class="highlight">veerinb</span> and <span class="highlight">mkkotch</span> for dinner, and spent a good amount of time just talking about things.</p>
                <p>While we were walking through the sois, we passed the <a href="https://www.samyan-mitrtown.com/">Samyan Mitrtown</a> mall complex. <span class="highlight">talkon</span> prompted the question:</p>
                <p class="u-egg-back" align="center"><i>What is the English cognate to "Mitr"?</i></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Let's fill in with some context. The Thai word มิตร <span class="ipa">/mit/</span>, romanized as "Mitr" as seen in that Samyan Mitrtown mall, means friend, or of relating to friendship. Thai also has other words for friend, for example เพื่อน <span class="ipa">/pɯən/</span> or สหาย <span class="ipa">/sa.ha:j/</span>. Mitr is a borrowed term, coming from the now extinct language Sanskrit. We got to learn in school that Thai has loads of borrowed words, to the point where we can sort of identify borrowed words in our every day language.</p>
                <p>Sanskrit was spoken in the Indian subcontinent some millennia ago, and was the primary language of Buddhist text and prayers. Thai probably got linguistic influence from Sanskrit along with the spread of Buddhism.</p>
                <p>This is where the extent of my knowledge ends. But the curiosity didn't end there! Linguists have been reconstructing what is called "proto" languages out of language families that are thought to originate from the same common ancestor. This is where it starts to look a bit like a family tree. Some proto languages are now pretty accepted in the linguistic field, while some others are still pretty much up for debate. From this point on, most of the information is (shamelessly) pulled from Wiktionary. Sanskrit is within the Indo-Aryan language group, the descendants of which are now spoken mostly in South Asia, like Hindi and Tamil. Going further up, we have the Indo-Iranian languages, with some descendants like Persian, and ultimately, the Indo-European languages.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">Proto-Indo-European</a> has been reconstructed, and it is hypothesized that this is the language people of Central Asia spoke some 6,000 years ago. It is the mother of so many languages spoken now including French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Romanian (known collectively as the Romance languages, descending from Latin); Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh (known collectively as Celtic languages); English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic (known collectively as Germanic languages); Latvian and Lithuanian (known collectively as the Baltic languages); Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian (known collectively as the Slavic languages); Greek; Albanian; and of course, the Indo-Iranian languages I just mentioned. The extent to which Indo-European vocabulary penetrates across the world is astonishing! A good example is my native language Thai - Thai isn't considered as an Indo-European language, but we borrowed quite a lot of Sanskrit words.</p>
                <p>This means that we can go up the family tree and find our long lost cousins of Thai words in the English language! Words that are "cousins" are called cognates, which brings us back to <span class="highlight">talkon</span>'s question. What is the English cognate to "Mitr"?</p>

                <p>I spent a few hours yesterday digging through Wiktionary to map out the long lost cousins of Mitr. Of course, the meaning of words change over time, and also while being borrowed into another language. So even though Mitr in Thai (and Lao and Khmer) means friend or friendship, the original suspected meaning in Proto-Indo-European is "to bind". When this word is descended to Ancient Greek, the meaning narrowed down to that thing that binds your hair together - a headband. As it goes to Latin, to the Romance languages and found its way into English, the meaning became specialized to not only any headband/headgear, but a holy one for bishops. Alas, our long lost cousin word is found, and it is miter (American spelling) - that hat bishops wear. I don't think a lot of people know this word since it isn't used as much in daily life conversation, so I guess our luck wasn't the best with this one.</p>
                <p>However, on the bright side I very much enjoyed the process of going through this and putting this together into a map you can see above. Consider this the first installation of potentially many more to come!</p>
                <p>Back to work, I guess...</p>
