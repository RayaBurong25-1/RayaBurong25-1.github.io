                <p>The other day I was enjoying my daily however-many-hours on YouTube when I came across this very interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6U7YFPrz6Y">video</a> about the expansion of New Amsterdam / New York City from its first settlements up until today. I really dig it - the animation, the score and the everything is really good.</p>
                <p>...Which got me thinking. I want to do the same for Bangkok as well. Count that as yet another potentially-infinitely long project idea I'm excited to start.</p>
                <p>I did some stitching of maps in different zoom levels from OpenStreetMap, and then I embarked on my first subproject: the expansion of the skytrain systems in Bangkok. I've never come across such an animation for it, even though I've seen numerous ones for other cities around the world. Our first skytrain was over 20 years ago, but expansion was slow during the first several years. We are now entering the skytrain boom years, and quite a few more lines will be finished within the next few years!</p>
                <p>I traced the current lines and research the opening dates for the stations (mostly on Wikipedia) - up until the end of this year. Enjoy:</p>

                <p>Stay tuned for some more Bangkok Evolution blogs, which should culminate into something quite like that video. I already have a couple ideas for the next couple blog posts!</p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: I'm using skytrain and "rapid transit" interchangeably because for the most part our rapid transit system lies above ground and is called the skytrain, plus the word skytrain just looks better.</p>
                <p><b>Another note</b>: Since I'm using DaVinci Resolve to edit this, I could have done a better job at conveying time, for example a progress bar at the bottom or an contantly changing YYYY/MM. This is a quick cheap subproject though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ At first I wanted to make it a gif as well.</p>
                <p><b>Yet another note</b>: This past couple blog posts probably qualify as reddit content and/or are somewhat reasonable to be put on some Wikipedia page. Should I post there as well?</p>
