                <p>No time is as good for reflection as being home during the long federal holiday, with rain falling hard, listening to <i>folklore</i>, all the while waiting for code to finish running. I'm anticipating that this particular article will be edited quite a bit, so this won't be a light raw article.</p>
                <p>This pandemic has been such a blow to pretty much all of us. Our expectation of 2020 and the actual 2020 can't be more different. Alas, it is not time to dwell on what 2020 could have been. During my time at home I've got to rest, become physically alone for a long period of time, and so far this summer I've gone outside to meet my friends once a week or so, and worked on a full-time UROP. Here's what the culmination of past experiences, being home and going out intermittently resulted in.</p>
                <div>
                    <h2>Meeting Up</h2>
                    <p>Last year, I flew back from the US early July and only had about 43 days to spend in Thailand before having to go back to the US for MIT's orientation. Fifteen of those days were spent going outside to meet up with friends. I had a great time meeting friends from way back in junior high, friends from senior high as well as Thai Scholar friends and other friends from Thailand I met in the US. This year, I had an unexpected flight back from the US in mid-March. Four months in, I've only gone outside on eleven days, mostly with the same group of friends - a stark difference. Sometimes when I'm at home I think about all the "could have beens" - other friends meeting other friends while I'm just at home. How come I don't get invited to some meetups or trips? Sometimes as I go through stories on Instagram I can't help but feel a bit lonely inside and sometimes I even feel envy of my friends.</p>
                    <p>I think I've come to terms with it now. While I can put part of the blame onto the pandemic, I sought for the other links or explanations for quite a while. I've cocncluded that there are two more things that can explain this.</p>
                    <p>I'm less active this year than last year. Last year I was truly eager to meet my friends, because it's the first time I'm back from the US, because I only had 43 days to spend, because I had the energy to go all the way to some university campuses to randomly meet up with friends who study there. This year I've turned quite passive - it's the second time I'm back from the US, the situation's not quite right, I have indefinite time to spend, I don't have all that much energy to roam around anymore because I work a full time job (on a weird schedule too I must add). All this adds up. Keeping up with friendship requires both parties. I can't expect my friends to come invite me all the time, sometimes I have to be the one initiating the meetup. Keeping up with friendship is somewhat a chore - you move up and down in the "closeness" ranking for each friend. I might be in the top 2 to be invited by one person (and I'm extremely grateful for that), but I might also be only in the top 50 or top 100 or top 500 or top 1000 to be invited by some other peopel. If I talk to someone often lately I might move up the ranks. If I leave the conversation dormant for a while I might move down the ranks. Of course it is much more complicated than that too - there's context to everything. Heck, I'd invite a different set of people if the event is, say, ice-skating, compared to walking around in Old Town Bangkok.</p>
                    <p>That said, I have no right to be whiny about people not inviting me for a meetup. I've learnt to look at it from another perspective. Mentality changes everything. Flipping that around, this becomes: if I'm invited, I feel validated and grateful that I'm in the top choices for that person. Otherwise I have no right to complain - it was me who didn't participate enough in their lives to move up the ranks. If I want to reap, I need to sow.</p>
                    <p>One can never do justice to inviting enough people for something. If a person has a friend group, sweet - that line's defined. It's a pretty thick line on that ranking board they drew. However, on the contrary, if there wasn't a thick line on the ranking board to begin with, where do you draw the line? If you invite some amount of people, they'd want to invite their friends high on their ranking board who might not be high on yours. Then you might be compelled to invite more of your friends on your ranking board. Then as the invitation list grows, it gets increasingly awkward. I think we all agree that we aren't keen on the idea of inviting 100+ people to something casual (the only event I can think of where I might invite that much is weddings). Is 50 people too much? Is 20 people too much? Is 12 people too much? As the number gets smaller, people's answers start to differ, let alone which set of people it should be.</p>

                    <h2>Social media</h2>
                    <p>I'm pretty late to the social media game, but that doesn't make me any less prone to selling my soul to them.</p>
                    <p>The first time I realized someone took me out of their followers...</p>
                    <p>Especially during the pandemic, the number of friends, the number of followers or the number of people I'm following have become a quantitative measure of how I'm doing socially - which shouldn't be.</p>
                    <p>Actively engage and be friends with more than 150 people at any moment</p>
                    <p>I'm just falling of the ranks, not necessarily stop becoming a friend of someone unless I do something really badly</p>

                    <h2>Holy Grail</h2>
                    <p>I am the main character in my movie. My friends are the supporting characters, which means that they should have some interaction with me, the main character, but not to the point where the they become the plot of my movie. It's my movie, after all. I get the say.</p>
                    <p>Help others, befriend others, but don't forget yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Backstory</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Friendship is particularly valuable for me. I wanted to be a friend to everyone.</p>
                    <p>I went as far as to keep track of who I get to talk to each day, and who I didn't.</p>
                    <p>I might qualify as having social anxiety, I don't know.</p>
                </div>
                <p>I'm extremely grateful for the friendships I've made throughout the years.</p>
