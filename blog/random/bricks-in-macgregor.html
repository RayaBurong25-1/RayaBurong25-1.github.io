            <div>
                <p>The other day I was talking to a prefrosh and we stumbled upon an interesting fact about MacGregor House, the dorm that I was in my freshman year (and would have been the dorm I'm writing this blog from if all this COVID-19 situation didn't happen). The <a href="http://macgregor.mit.edu/about">official website for the dorm</a> says that there are <i>exactly</i> 14,685,923,700,000,000 bricks in MacGregor. This is equal to 1.46859237 x 10<sup>16</sup> in scientific notation. We were skeptical.</p>
                <p>The prefrosh <span class="highlight">chaiscyp</span> did a quick volume estimation to debunk the number. He said that if a brick were to be 10cm by 10cm by 10cm = a volume of 1000 cm<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, that total number of bricks will take up some 1.46859237 x 10<sup>13</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. Assuming, he said, that the building is 20m tall (I then corrected him that that's not the case - the height of MacGregor is roughly 3m x 17 floors = 51m but it doesn't change a lot of things), the ground area of the building would be ‭7.34296185‬ x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. Take a square root of that and the length of a hypothetical square MacGregor building that is 100% brick is at a hilarious 856,910.84 meters. I've seen HUGE buildings, like the new Istanbul airport, but this is just... unrealistic.</p>
                <p>This got me thinking... what <i>actually</i> is the count of bricks in MacGregor? Since I'm still in a 14-day self quarantine, this counts as a very productive way to spend my time. But first of all:</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>How big is one brick in MacGregor House?</h2>
                    <p>Since I have been evicted from the dorm, I could not take direct measurements, and this question is thus harder to answer. I could potentially text <span class="highlight">cjq</span> who is one of the few who got an exemption to stay on campus (stay safe!) but this is a pressing issue and it is currently 3am EDT and he might already be asleep. He might not be. But that's not the main point of this blog. Also asking him would just take the fun away from this blog post.</p>
                    <p><i>Note: SIGNIFICANT FIGURES WILL BE A MESS I'M SORRY I JUST LIKE A LOT OF DECIMAL PLACES</i></p>
                    <p>Now I have some photographic evidence that would help me figure this out. Behold the photo of my room's wall the day that I left campus. In hindsight, I first want to curse myself for not taking a photo of the whole side wall of my room. However, in my own defense, there were boxes on the floor and taking a photos of the whole side wall would ruin the aesthetic. I'll have to work with what I have. I'll assume that the bedframe is h = 0.60m tall and the floor hieght is f = 42.35m/15 floors = <b>2.8233m</b> (this is measured in Google Earth from the bottom of floor 1 of E entry up to the top of floor 16 - the Associate Head of House's apartment as seen in the figure below)</p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <img width="100%" style="object-fit:cover" src="bricks-in-macgregor-1.png" />
                    </div>
                    <p>With that set, the height of the brick is thus (f - h)/22.5 = <b>0.0988133m</b>.</p>
                    <p>Wait a minute...</p>
                    <p>I just saw that my photo actually goes down to the floor, on the right, if you look closely. 35 bricks plus half-ish the width of a brick equals the height of the whole floor, which I'm guesstimating to be some 2m, accounting for the ceiling stuff and the floor stuff and not counting that half-ish the width of a brick. This puts the height of the brick at 2m/35 = <b>0.0571428m</b>. Mmmkay. I'll just veto and say it's around the average of the two and use <b>0.08m</b> for ease of further calculation.</p>
                    <p>Now for the width of the brick. First guesstimate gives it at 3 times the height of a brick, so <b>0.24m</b>. However, I think I can do better. The width of the bed frame (the inside distance between the two poles) is the width of a <a href="https://www.dimensions.guide/element/twin-xl-bed">Twin XL bed</a> - which is 0.97m. How many bricks is it? Four, so each brick is 0.97m/4 = <b>0.2425m</b>. That's actually pretty consistent! I'll veto and use <b>0.24m</b> then.</p>
                    <p>As for the length of the brick... I'll have to c r o p and z o o m. Let's go into my favorite image editing software! The brick that has an A on it is a pretty good reference because light kinda bounced to form the outline of the brick in the shadow, as you can see in the picture below. Rectangle Select got 35 pixels x 57 pixels for that face of the brick, which means the length of the brick is 0.08m x 35 / 57 = <b>0.0491228m</b>. Let's use <b>0.05m</b>.</p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <img width="100%" style="object-fit:cover" src="bricks-in-macgregor-2.jpg" />
                    </div>
                    <p>There is an answer! A brick is estimated to be <b>0.08m x 0.24m x 0.05m</b>. The volume is 9.6 x 10<sup>-4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, pretty close to that first assumption of the volume of a brick. Given this, it reconfirms that the original number is too weird to be true. This information might or might not be used in the later sections.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>How many bricks are there in one room?</h2>
                    <p>A room in MacGregor House usually has a thicc brick wall and a thin wooden wall. That's why we have a thicc wall neighbor and a thin wall neighbor! The other two sides of the wall are also covered in brick, but there's a window in most of one and a door in the other. I have no idea if the floors and ceilings are laid down by brick, but I'd assume no, because otherwise we'd have bumpy floors. Not sure how valid this reasoning is, because our floors are carpeted which would hide the bumpiness but I'm just gonna roll with it.</p>
                    <p>As already mentioned above, the height of each room is 35 bricks high plus half-ish the width of a brick. Let's just say it's 36.5. From the photo alone, I can't determine how many bricks line the length or width of the room, so we're gonna have to be more creative here. Lo and behold, <a href="https://floorplans.mit.edu/pdfs/W61_2.pdf">the almighty floor plan</a> along with the image editing boi coming to the rescue!</p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <img width="100%" style="object-fit:cover" src="bricks-in-macgregor-3.png" />
                    </div>
                    <p>I took screenshots of the floor plan. The graphic scale is 48ft = 721px (grrr I hate imperial units), and the room is, from the middle of the each corner of the walls (walls have thickness), 133px x 208px = 8.8543689ft x 13.8474341ft = <b>2.6988117m x 4.2206979m</b>. Yes, our single rooms are about 122ft<sup>2</sup> or 11.4m<sup>2</sup> in area. Going off a tangent for a little bit: since the rent for the 2020-2021 academic year will be <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/housing/undergraduate-housing/residence-halls/undergraduate-housing-rates">$5,810</a> per semester, a MacGregor single will cost about $1.79 an hour or 3 cents a minute, which is 15.7 cents an hour per square meter / 1.5 cents an hour per square foot. Make it whatever you will.</p>
                    <p>The thickness of the wall is 8px at the door, 10px at the thicc wall and 15px at the window. This translates to 0.1623345m, 0.2029182m and 0.3043772m. Pretend the door and the window don't exist, use only half the thickness of the walls, and I have a total ground area per room of 0.5 x 0.1623345m x 2.6988117m + 0.5 x 0.2029182m x 4.2206979m + 0.5 x 0.3043772m x 2.6988117m = <b>1.0580117m<sup>2</sup></b>. The number of bricks is thus 1.0580117m<sup>2</sup> / (0.24m x 0.08m) = 55.1047760 bricks per each room's ground area. The total number of bricks per each room is 55.1047760 bricks x 36.5 bricks = <b>2,011.324324</b> bricks.</p>

                    <h2>How many rooms are there in MacGregor?</h2>
                    <p>This is a rather a question of which rooms count. Most, if not all rooms have brick walls, but the sizes are different and this wil mess things up. If I count only the rooms that are used for undergraduate housing, there are 312 single rooms and 3 double rooms, totalling 315 rooms, according to <a href="https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/map/macgregor-house">MIT guide to residences</a>. If I want to count <i>all</i> the roons in the whole building, I can CTRL+F the <a href="https://floorplans.mit.edu/cgi-bin-db-mit/wdbmitscript.asp?Report=ibrl&Item=MIT">building room list</a>, getting a total of 138 (W61) + 91 (A) + 91 (B) + 91 (C) + 91 (D) + 86 (E) + 102 (F) + 99 (G) + 99 (H) + 75 (J) + 4 (House Master) = 967 rooms. For the purposes of estimation, I'll take an arithmetic mean and use <b>641</b> rooms.</p>

                    <p>Using this ground area method, we get a total of: 2,011.324324 x 641 = <b>1,289,258.891684</b> bricks.</p>

                    <h2>What if we use Minecraft?</h2>
                    <p>During this Zoom era, the people in the busy beavers discord have come up with a project of building a virtual MIT in Minecraft, hopefully for prefrosh who haven't had the chance to explore the campus to know what it looks like. I, together with <span class="highlight">talkon</span> and a few other people built MacGregor House. We used the floor plan to model the building and tried to pin it down accurate to the square meter. It is, as of writing, about 75% finished and it's very surreal seeing the dorm I live in on Minecraft!</p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <img width="100%" style="object-fit:cover" src="bricks-in-macgregor-4.png" />
                    </div>
                    <p>The wonderful thing about this server is that there is worldedit, which is a powerful mod that you can use to copy, paste, set a volume to some block and replace things with some constraints. I replaced minecraft:bricks to minecraft:pumpkins (yes, there's only one correct choice) and the command results in 12,673 block replacements. Now this figure doesn't include brick stairs, but I can't use the replace method to get the number of brick stair blocks the same way I found out the number of brick blocks. Since each block in Minecraft represents 1 cubic meter, this results in 12,673m<sup>3</sup> / (0.08m x 0.24m x 0.05m) = <b>13,201,041.666667</b> bricks.</p>
                    <p>Hmm... why is this figure so different from the first method? This might be because the smallest unit in Minecraft is 1 meter, thus all the walls have to be 1 meter thick. From the floor plan and the image editing boi I used, walls have a thickness of between 0.1623345m and 0.3043772m. A lazy average of the two gives 0.2333559, and that means the actual number of bricks is closer to 13,201,041.666667 x 0.2333559 = <b>3,080,540.9590626</b> bricks.</p>
                    <h3><span class="highlight">Method II: Minecraft = 3,080,541 bricks</span></h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>What if we use time?</h2>
                    <p>We can get even more creative and instead of using area or volume to estimate, we can use another dimension entirely: time. A reputable source to help with this method is <i>MIT Campus Planning, 1960-2000: An Annotated Chronology</i> by O. Robert Simha, a preview of which is available on Google Books. If I were on campus I would have picked up this book since it sounds like an interesting read! However, COVID-19, you know the rest.</p>
                    <p>The dorm was dedicated in 1970, so I think it's safe to assume that construction should've finished by September 1970, where the first batch of MacGregorites inhabit the dorm. From what I recall, the latest budgeting or planning occured in May 1968 (I can't really confirm this since I've reached my preview limit for this book on Google Books already whoops). Since planning must certainly precede construction, at least that's what I assume, this gives a time window of 28 months.</p>
                    <p>How many bricks did the construction crew lay in this period of time? According to a refutable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIDES8pWR6Q">video</a> of a person laying bricks, from 1:44 minutes to 6:20 minutes he laid down 24 bricks, averaging 11.5 seconds per brick. Of course the size of the brick is not the same and there are a bunch of variables that influence the speed of brick laying.</p>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/">this website</a>, an average weekly hours worked in 1968 was around 42 hours a week. Now, the only thing left, which is hardest to guess, is the number of people who worked on building MacGregor simultaneously. What is quite certain is that the number should be between 10 and 100 and since they're only one order of magnitude apart why not just take a lazy average of the two and use that to base our estimation on? 55 it is.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the number of bricks laid would be 28 months x (365.25 days / 12 months) x (1 week / 7 days) x (42 hours / week) x (3600 seconds / hour) x (1 brick / 11.5 seconds) x 55 people = <b>88,041,130.4347826</b> bricks. Woah okay. This is so much more than the other two methods. Obviously I overshot by a lot since the construction period very likely did not take that long, there might not be that many people laying down bricks at the same time, the whole brick laying period might not have spanned the whole construction period, not all days are good for work, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Let's try to account for that. I'm gonna say that construction took 24 months instead of 28 cutting down some pre and post construction and maybe snowy days, then I'll assume that the brick laying process should only be a sixth of that time (reasoning: equal amounts of time for laying the brick and structure, doing the pipes and wires, and furnishing the outside and inside - brick laying should be half of the first stage. I'm no construction worker so I know nothing about this). I'm gonna change the number of people down to 10 because at least in my imagination it doesn't seem likely to have that many people laying down bricks at the same time.</p>
                    <p>The number of bricks laid would be 24 months x (1/6) x (365.25 days / 12 months) x (1 week / 7 days) x (42 hours / week) x (3600 seconds / hour) x (1 brick / 11.5 seconds) x 10 people = <b>2,286,782.6086957</b> bricks. Yes I realize I'm trying to tweak numbers to make it closer to the other two methods, but it kinda makes sense to change the assumptions this way to get a more accurate estimation, no?</p>

                    <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
                    <p>It is currently 1pm EDT and I've spent so many hours writing out this blog. Don't worry, I ate my meals, took some breaks, answered more questions from prefrosh and called my friends and my family in the meantime as well, so I'm not <i>that</i> bored. With three methods I can safely conclude that the number of bricks in MacGregor is on the sixth order of magnitude, not sixteenth. To take the humor all the way and be ridiculously precise, my final estimate will be, you guessed it, a horrible lazy average of the three methods.</p>
