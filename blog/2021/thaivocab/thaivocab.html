                <p>So I've had this lingering question in my mind. I knew pretty well, as a native Thai speaker who's taught some classes about Thai in MIT Splash as well (self promotion, why not), that our vocabulary borrows from many languages: Pali, Sanskrit, Khmer, English, Chinese in different ages, etc. A mildly related blog post is <a href="../../../random/mitr.html">this one where I talk about Mitr</a>.</p>
                <p>However, something I don't know is... <i>how much</i> borrowing there is. For example, in our day to day lives, what percentage of our words is descended from Thai's ancestors (denoted as Proto-Southwestern Tai and further up the lineage, Proto-Tai), and what percentage of our words is borrowed from where.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="u-egg-back">
                <p>Yesterday I wrote a quick script to try to answer that question. I started first by writing a scraping method that scrapes news articles from <a href="https://www.thaipbs.or.th/home">ThaiPBS</a>, our country's public broascasting system. This is where the first detail comes in. Thai has multiple registers, aka language levels, for different occasions or when talking to different people. An analogy for something like this is, say, you probably won't say yeet (I know, it's so 2019) when writing an email to the Department of Education, and you probably won't say "my sincerest apologies" to your close friend when you step on their toes unless you're weird like that. This is the same as if you say ‡πÅ‡∏î‡∏Å <span class="ipa">[d√¶ÃÄÀêkÃö]</span> <i>eat</i> (with a low tone, long vowel and no audible release - I'm being a little bit extra here) in an email to the Department of Education rather than a more suitable ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏ô <span class="ipa">[raÃÅpÃö.praÃÄ.t ∞aÃÑÀên]</span> <i>eat, literally receive a grant</i>. Thai formally has five registers, one for the royal family, one for monks, one for rhetorics, one for formal writings, and one colloquial.</p>
                <p>By limiting myself to scraping from ThaiPBS, I'm only inspecting level number 4 - formal writings. Generally, a higher percentage of colloquial Thai is from proto-Tai, and the higher the register, the lower that percentage. This is somewhat close to how "cow", from Middle English, is in a lower register than the chopped up and served "beef", borrowed from Old French. Not the best analogy because their meanings have diverged, but good enough. Also funny how French-borrowed words in English are essentially the same words that have taken an alternative path from Proto-Indo-European. In Thai, this is not necessarily the case, unless we assume all languages descend from a "Proto-World".</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Once scraping from ThaiPBS is done, I tokenize the article text using <a href="https://pythainlp.github.io/">PyThaiNLP</a> (more specifically <a href="https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/attacut">Attacut</a>) and straight up looked each word up in Wiktionary. Wiktionary entries are usually formatted like the one I screenshotted above, where it could have an Etymology section, sometimes definitive and sometimes not really. I did some regex to make it try to find the first language after the word "From" if possible, or the first language after the word "Cognate" if there isn't really a "From," or label it ONA (Other or Not Available) otherwise. Sometimes Attacut likes to output compound words (as it should), whose etymology on Wiktionary is simply just "word a + word b" - for this I'm a bit too lazy to scrape further, so ONA it is. Sometimes there are no entries for the word, and for that I mark it "Not Found".</p>
                <p>Those words that have a cognate with Northern Thai/Lao/Shan possibly descended straight from Proto-Tai, but in this case I still separated them anyway. There might have been some errors in the regex because some words are marked as borrowed from Lao - I'm not sure what is going on there.</p>
                <p>Some words have multiple meanings and multiple etymologies. In this case, I simply put them all in. This might have skewed the results in some direction, but I'm not quite sure how to fix it. It seems a bit too manual to assume which words in the articles are likely which meaning.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after like an hour of coding and debugging and making sure neither ThaiPBS nor Wiktionary puts my IP address on a ban, here are the results! Pardon me for the relatively random order - it's the same order as outputted from the dictionary üòÇ</p>

            <div class="u-egg-back">
                <canvas id="chart" class="u-white-back" align="center"></canvas>
                <p>So it seems like, excluding ONA and Not Found, the proportion is roughly</p>
                <h3>13 Native : 4 Pali-Sanskrit : 3 Khmer : 1 Chinese : 1 English</h3>
                <p>Pretty cool! Will work towards eliminating some errors and uncertainties if I have time.</p>
