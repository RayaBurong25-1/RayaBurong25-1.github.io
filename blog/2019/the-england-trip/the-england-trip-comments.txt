Firstly, there was a technical issue with the VAC (or the system, or VFS Global, I wasn't made clear on that) where my appointment time was postponed indefinitely and I wasn't notified beforehand. Only when I went to the VAC did the staff notify me - consider other ways I could be contacted: email, phone? I was directed to check the VFS Global website daily for any updates surrounding the disruption, which to be honest, is quite a terrible method of execution given that email addresses and phone numbers were given already. I finally got to the VAC again more than half a month later.

Secondly, once I submitted my documents through VFS Global, there was no notification whatsoever whether the documents have been received and checked by the agency, are complete or deficient, or have been sent to the decision-making center. An email would have been nice. The only tracking method available was through UPS - which only indicated whether the documents were sent successfully to the VFS Global center. It was like a black box that I had no method of knowing any information about the progress of my VISA.

Thirdly, the timing was unacceptable and customer services were tardy and unhelpful. I waited for more than a month, well beyond the 15 business day mark I read about and the 2-3 day decision-making standard UKVI set up. Where were my documents - lost along the way, accepted, declined, or changed hands? I have sent multiple emails to inquire about the status, to no avail. I have also attempted to call, but seeing that it costed money deferred me. By the time the VISA arrived, the time period clocked in at an impressive 2 months and 7 days.

For a comparison, I applied for a VISA to the USA during a relatively close time period, and the whole process took me 3 weeks and 3 days, 2.83 times faster.
