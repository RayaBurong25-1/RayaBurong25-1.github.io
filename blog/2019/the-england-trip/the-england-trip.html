                <p>My, my. This is the spicier part of 2019.</p>
                <p>So, my brother graduated his bachelor‚Äôs degree back in June. This nearly coincides with my own graduation from prep school, which is in early June, so I decided that since I‚Äôm going back to Thailand anyway, and England is on the way from Boston to Bangkok (if you fly east, as least), why not stop my and celebrate this momentous moment (haha) in my brother‚Äôs life. Also, I‚Äôd get to add one to my list of countries travelled to as well.</p>
                <p>So began my process of planning a trip to England, doing the paperwork and finding something to do during the wait. The last one was the easiest ‚Äì I asked Chris Brown of Brewster Academy Summer Programs if I could be a TA there for the incoming Thai Scholars ‚Äô62. Normally the TAs there are two years older than the incoming class, but I was an exception case. Everything came out well, and I thank Chris for being receptive. This, is a story for another day.</p>
                <p>The first one is relatively easy as well. I am this kind of person who‚Äôd rather prefer planning vacations day by day, and not having a detailed plan months beforehand. It‚Äôs just easier and less stressful that way (you could argue that I am lazy and procrastinate as well, but I call that setting priorities.) Anyway, the only thing that‚Äôs scheduled for then was the graduation ceremony, which obviously is fixed and I can‚Äôt miss (it‚Äôs the point of me going there anyway.) Other than that, I briefly planned to hit both Cambridge and London for several days and all is good.</p>
                <p>Paperwork.</p>
                <p>By late March, I started the process of getting a tourist VISA to the United Kingdom. The lengthy application is filled out. The application asked for some official documents of why the hell you would want to visit this then-glorious-empire-but-now-a-crumby-rainy-place, where I‚Äôll be staying each night, and if I have enough money to leave the country because the country doesn‚Äôt want one more immigrant. Sure, I asked my brother for an official invitation from the university. We agreed on a play to stay in London and Cambridge (his dorm room), and I send in my documents about my wealth. Application done!</p>
                <p>The UK VISA is tied with VFS Global who f a c i l i t a t e s the document shipping process for applicants. This information will be important later.</p>
                <p>Now, the VISA process requires me to send in biometrics as well ‚Äì fingerprints and self-portrait ‚Äì and for the US, there are several places ‚ÄúApplication Support Centres‚Äù spread around the country that I could visit to get those done (my spellcheck doesn‚Äôt accept this lol). Okay, I made an appointment for the 12<sup>th</sup> of April at the Boston ASC, which is the most convenient time because I would have been in Boston then for CPW anyway, so I can slip out of the activities and go get it all done with. I woke up, took the public transport (at this point I can‚Äôt remember if I took the bus or the Blue Line or both), and arrived a bit early to the ASC which is all the way in Revere. At the center, I was greeted by the counter to be informed that there are some ‚Äútechnical issues‚Äù and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do my biometrics until further notice. They handed me a piece of paper that tells me the website I have to check <i>daily</i> to see then the service is restored.</p>
                <p>This got me fuming. (1) I travelled for an hour to Revere to get a notice on a piece of paper to come again? This is the best possible way already, right? Did I give me email and phone number for nothing? (2) The <i>daily</i> website checking got me as well. Such a good way to let people know huh.</p>
                <p>About a week later, when I‚Äôm back in Exeter, the technical problem was solved, and so they started letting people who were affected come back to get their biometrics done. Luckily, I was going to Boston again on April 30<sup>th</sup> for a forum, so I could finish the biometrics. I sneaked out of the Hynes convention center, excused my teacher, and went out to Revere to get things done. It was relatively quick, and I‚Äôm glad the process could continue now.</p>
                <p>I registered by VISA application on VFS global, and purchased a roundtrip courier for $70. Damn that‚Äôs expensive, but okay I‚Äôll take it. I printed the labels and plopped everything down the mailbox in Exeter.</p>
                <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
                <p>The expected processing time was two weeks. No problem, I proceeded to spend my spring term as normal. There is no way to track the status of the VISA application, which is unfortunate, but I guess it is for the sake of confidentiality?</p>
                <p>Classes went on pretty well, and before I realize it, I‚Äôm already getting close to graduation. It was mid-May and it was past the expected 15 business day processing duration. I started to lose my mind, and searched for ways to contact VFS Global to ask where the hell my documents were. After multiple back-and-forth emails from me, I didn‚Äôt receive any helpful answers.</p>
                <p>Graduation weekend came, and I‚Äôm even more frantic, because my passport cannot be tracked and there is a chance that when it comes back to Exeter, I would have left. I contacted the person at Exeter who‚Äôs in charge of processing VISA for students (for study abroad and stuff ‚Äì my process didn‚Äôt go through her) and explained the situation. She chuckled, and offered to mail the passport to wherever I would be come mid-June. Great, now there is even a possibility that the passport will not come to me in time for the trip! How long had the process been? THREE MONTHS.</p>
                <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
                <p>Fortunately, a package arrived during my time in the Brewster Summer Program, containing my passport with a VISA to visit the great united-ish kingdom of United Kingdom (ü§î). Only then was I able to book flights, and by then the prices has gone up quite a bit already. Nice job.</p>
                <p>The day to fly to England came, and I said farewell to all the TS62, fellow TAs and Chris Brown. One adventure ended, another was about to begin. I was driven to Portsmouth, took a bus to Boston Logan Airport, and flew the first leg to Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>At Philadelphia, it turned out that flight to London was overbooked<sup>TM</sup>. The receptionist offered two options: to continue being in the waitlist, or to voluntarily take the alternative that is to go to Manchester and then take the flight to London, and will arrive there a couple hours later than the first option ‚Äì with a $1300 compensation. More things to freak out about! After waiting at the gate nervously, I got called to board the plane. The receptionist was there to check my passport, and smiled. It was a wholesome moment.</p>
                <p>#Tangent here: I wasn‚Äôt made clear which Manchester it was ‚Äì there were both flights to Manchester NH and Manchester UK going at 9pm, and I searched up and found flights from both Manchesters to London. Maybe they wouldn‚Äôt yield the same time and I would be able to find out which one it was, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to find out.</p>
                <p>I arrived at London Heathrow and took the tube (tube!) to King‚Äôs Cross. A funny incident happened while I came out of the King‚Äôs Cross underground station. Keep in mind that I had with myself one large luggage, one smaller luggage and a backpack as this whole England trip was along the way home. I tried to push my two luggage bags through the non-wide slot. The exit closed on me, and I got shouted by the tube personnel: <span class="highlight">‚ÄúMate, you‚Äôre trying to come out with t w o luggage bags, mate! There‚Äôs the wide opening here mate!‚Äù</span></p>
                <p>Yep, I‚Äôm in England.</p>
                <p>The several days in Cambridge was fun. I caught the last day at the college my brother was in and strolled around the campus for my first day. My second day was the graduation, I wore a suit, my brother wore something strange and very British, and I was his personal photographer for the day. I got to eat in the celebratory lunch at the college, and got to ride a bus to the venue of the actual holy graduation ceremony straight out of the middle ages. We got to explore downtown Cambridge a bit as well! The last day at Cambridge I accompanied the packing, went to the botanical garden, and caught the train to London. I was crazy enough to be standing on the aisle in the crowded train and whip up my laptop to work. Fun times.</p>
                <p>We arrived at King‚Äôs Cross, and made our way to the tube stop nearest to our hostel. The escalator was exceptionally long, and the two luggage bags backfired on me. I slipped, the bags fell on me, and I fell down the escalator. This caused some bleeding wounds, and the tube officers came to help. There was a change of plans, and instead of walking to the hostel we hailed a black taxi (black taxi!) I stayed indoors for the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>The next day we explored the three museums of South Kensington: Museum of Science, Museum of Natural History and Virginia and Albert Museum. The day after we went around the touristy London and hit the overrated places like Big Ben (which was under maintenance), the London Eye, the War Museum, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, among others.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Verdict: the most obstacles during a visit to a country, but I guess that‚Äôs the price that comes in exchange with not having rainfall during those 6 days at all. Overall pretty glad to have explored this land. Would come again if VFS Global goes out of business.</p>
                <p>Bonus: around late July UK VISA sent me a feedback form. <a href="the-england-trip-comments.txt" class="highlight">Here‚Äôs</a> my comments.</p>
