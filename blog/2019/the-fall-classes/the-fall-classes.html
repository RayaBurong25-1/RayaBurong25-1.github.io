                <p>MIT is working on being very generous to its incoming freshman, as they have provided us with a few conveniences to make the process of adjusting to “hell” a rather smooth ride. For one, we have P/NR, which is pass/no record. If you pass, you pass and it appears in your transcript. If not, it magically disappears without any trace – at least in the official transcript that outsiders will see! The cherry on top to the P/NR is that GIRs, no matter if you take them this term or otherwise, will be P/NR as well – which means it is mathematically more worth it if you don’t take GIRs during freshman fall. A lot of people do so though. Well, each to their own, I guess.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this tangent is rather getting long, so I’ll steer closer to the today’s topic. The second of MIT’s conveniences is the credit limit – which I’m a strong opponent of. It serves as a soft limit to aid transition to college, and they say a credit limit will discourage people from being too OP, registering for 1,000,000,007 classes in the first term and die. They’d rather have people die later in their undergraduate journey.</p>
                <p>I am rebellious, so I took more than the credit limit. 5 though, not 1,000,000,007. See, the credit limit is 48 units (representing a predicted 48 hours per week spent on classes – 4 of 12 each), but I sneaked my way around, and became a listener for one more 12-unit class. That totals to 60 units this term. Believe it or not, I actually started with 7 potential classes to take this term. It took a couple weeks for me to narrow down to 5 that I stayed to the end of the term, with some dropped and some added, so this compilation will feature more than five classes. Here goes...</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>6.009: Fundamentals of Programming</h2>
                    <p>This was the first ever lecture I had in my MIT history, starting on a fine Wednesday morning at 9am before my sleep schedule became messed up. Honestly, I was so excited, but didn’t expect much from the class. After all, it was about the N-Queens problem. I had to leave after one hour (the lecture lasted half an hour more), but at that point I knew that this would be the last lecture I plan to attend for 6.009 this whole semester. And it’s true. Sorry Prof. Devadas, you’re quite cool but I already know the material. It resembles POSN camp 2, mixed in with a bit of OOP that I learnt in Mahidol.</p>
                    <p>The only things I have to do for this class are finishing the 10 weekly labs, and take the 3 quizzes. The labs are really a ramp, taking me from 1.5 hours to finish lab 1 to somewhere around 10 hours to finish labs 9 and 10 collectively. That’s 40% of the grade done on Friday afternoons. The annoying part is the checkoff where I need to travel to building 34 to explain what I’ve done to the LAs.</p>
                    <p>The quizzes? They consist of 3 questions, and resemble POSN camp 2 exams. I took about half the allotted time for all of them.</p>
                    <p>Overall? Low effort, fun, code.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>21G.301: French I</h2>
                    <p>This was the next class I went to on the first day. We started from the Bonjour and the Je m’appelle, and shortly I knew that this will be too boring, since I’d taken a whole year of French back in Mahidol. I talked to the teacher and she recommended me to check out French II. I recall some back-and-forth emails about how (1) I already have a credit limit, (2) the 11am class clashes with my 24.900 and (3) the 9am class is full so (4) I’m dropping out of French this term.</p>
                    <p>Well, turns out (3) is not true so consequently (4) is not true as well. And that’s the story of how I’m a listener in French II, because of (1).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>24.900: Introduction to Linguistics</h2>
                    <p>Yes, the schedule is really packed on this first day, and I’ve arrived in my third class of the morning. At last, I’m sitting in a class about linguistics – something I’ve always had interest in since childhood, which expanded thanks to Exeter’s linguistics club, <span class="highlight">gsychi</span> and NACLO.</p>
                    <p>Lin-f*cking-guistics! uhhh, no. Linguis-f*cking-tics?</p>
                    <p>Prof. Albright really brings humor to the classroom, and he never fails to disappoint me with all the “Savage Chickens” comic in the beginning of the slides, the chuckles along the way, and the quirky anecdotes that adds on to the theory.</p>
                    <p>Mmmmmm. Morphology. Syntax. Phonetics. Phonology. Semantics. Variation and Change. This course is jam packed with theory, but distilled enough that any layperson could understand – or at least, any MIT person.</p>
                    <p>Highly recommend. It is a CI-H and a HASS that doesn’t feel like one. It features a 3,000-word essay, a grammatical sketch about a language I don’t know, written after conducting research through interviews with a friend. Honestly, it didn’t seem long, and I enjoyed every part of it. There are two mini-quizzes as well, and this course as a whole does not require too much effort. If you like languages, cultures, or trees and tables and looking at patterns and puzzles, then this class is for you. I’d even argue that this might be the best popular HASS out there.</p>
                    <p>The workload is relatively little, and the worst part of the term is writing the said paper which could go up to 10 hours a week. Otherwise, it stays at around 2 to 4 hours per week outside of class. I also regret the fact that I doze off in class very often because of my never-improving sleep schedule.</p>
                    <p>Overall: humorous, broadening horizons, chill</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>4.021: Design Studio, How to Design</h2>
                    <p>After quite a bit of a lunch break, I headed over to the building next to MIT museum, and was struck by the artsy people and design studio up on the third floor. This course has a lottery, but I pulled myself out of the lottery before they selected the people who’d get into the class. However, judging from the introduction and the course syllabus, this course looks pretty dope and very focused on the portfolio. Might eat up quite a bit of time, but can’t tell for sure.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>21M.080: Introduction to Music Technology</h2>
                    <p>Alas, I arrived at the 6th course of the first day of MIT. This first day for 21M.080 didn’t feature much, except the fact that there is a lottery. This course goes through pretty much everything that qualifies as relating to music and relating to technology, from scales, waves, FFT, synthesis, sampling, Max MSP, mixing, microphones, acoustics, Reaper and DAWs, machine learning in music and more. It concludes with a week-long final project where students are free to do anything remotely related to music and technology.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Hattwick prefers having some freshmen along with the juniors and seniors who are in the music major, so I got in. There is a small quiz every Monday to test last week’s content, and that constitutes a significant portion of the grades. There are four larger two-week assignments, starting from subtractive synthesis, to polyphonic interface, sampling, and mixing a track. Fair warning: the software used in the class are proprietary, and the free trial runs out in the middle of the term. I had to purchase a month’s worth of Max MSP license, but it’s about $10.</p>
                    <p>It covers great breadth, and is a great way to start the wonderful journey of using technology to produce music. There is both theoretical (the more physics-y part) and practical (the more using software part) aspects, and they blend together quite nicely. The workload is moderate, a somewhat consistent 3 to 5 hours a week. Some inconveniences that could arise might include checking out the microphone from the music library and use it within a day.</p>
                    <p>Downside is that you’d be more susceptible to bad tracks, for example, I can notice sounds with amplitude clipping much better now, as well as tracks that aren’t properly mixed and faded out (*ahem* ADT, don’t just stop your tracks).</p>
                    <p>Overall? musical, in-breadth, highly interactive.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>21G.302: French II</h2>
                    <p>Good thing I didn’t have to do 6 classes a day for more than a day. Since that day, I have dropped out of 4.021 and 21G.301, and I’m trying my hand on 21G.302. The first day was absolutely the hardest – I had a hiatus from learning French for two years, and here I was, frantically finding where building 14N is, getting to the already-full classroom about 10 minutes late, and the class was conducted entirely in French.</p>
                    <p>A few classes in I kinda reactivated the French part of my brain, and the shock dissipated, so I understood more of what was going on in the class. I downloaded the pdf file of the textbook and bought the student activities manual from Amazon. The worst part of the class? Having to wake up to go to the 9am class. Towards the end of the term, I almost always arrive to class fashionably late at 9:10 (+5 minutes due to MIT time and another +5 minutes due to whatever reason – printing homework to class, possibly).</p>
                    <p>Honestly, I’m pretty satisfied with this class. I learnt so much more French, from passé compose, imparfait, future, to vocabulary and other grammar. The class is quite small with around ten people, and is highly interactive to the point where it is the only class I have not dozed off in, even though it is earliest in the morning. The class features popular culture such as songs and movies. “Comme d’habitude” was an earworm for quite some time, so I guess it’s a success for the class?</p>
                    <p>I had to strike a balance as to how much effort I put into the class, because I don’t want to spend too much of my week only doing French (well, my friends do seem to think that way in the end anyway), but at the same time I voluntarily enrolled in this course as a listener, so at least I should do assez bien. There are unit quizzes throughout the term, and unit homework as well as textbook homework every class. Workload is a consistent five hours per week.</p>
                    <p>Overall? Intéressant, interactif, souffrance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>6.042: Mathematics for Computer Science</h2>
                    <p>I went to 6.042 lecture once, sat with <span class="highlight">darrenl</span>, a newly made friend right down my dorm's hallway, in the afternoon of the second day of classes.</p>
                    <p>“Proofs, proofs, proofs”</p>
                    <p>After the lecture that proved that \sqrt{2} is irrational, among some other proofs of the day, I approached the TA to ask if I could skip the class, because I have studied proof techniques before. He suggested I skim the textbook to see if I recognize what content was.</p>
                    <p>I did, so I officially dropped from the class.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>6.046: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h2>
                    <p>On the third day of classes, upon self-evaluation, course exploration, and encouragement by my fellow friend <span class="highlight">talkon</span> to take 6.046, I went to check out the first recitation. It was about asymptotic notation and divide and conquer. Great, this is IPST camp 1+2 material. This looks fun, and challenging enough.</p>
                    <p>Fair warning, if you come from a more computer science background, you would recognize about 70% all the algorithms presented in this class, but the proofs... is another story. See, this class is about 70% math, from probability to induction to some basic inequality. I am not particularly good at those, so this class became more challenging than what I thought it would be at first. However, I still chose not to go to lectures, so that my Tuesdays and Thursdays don’t have ANY classes at all! I read lectures in my down time and take notes. Problem sets really helped me here.</p>
                    <p>There are ten weekly psets of moderate length, making 10% of the grade. There are two midterms, 25% of the grade each, and a final that is worth 40%. The first midterm is the “aha you’re all gonna fail and be paranoid for the rest of the term” kind of test, while the rest are moderately hard. I make dumb mistakes often, but I think I got good enough grades, average about +1ish SD each. It doesn’t help much that I’m close to <span class="highlight">talkon</span>, who tops the class in a couple tests.</p>
                    <p>It was a nice in-depth in-breadth course, covering many kinds of algorithms, for example FFT, hashing, randomized algorithms, MST, greedy, MaxFlow, DP, gradient descent, and touched upon other topics such NP and game theory. I definitely learnt so much from this one, as well as how to do LaTeX. Workload is quite heavy at upwards of six hours per week for me.</p>
                </div>
                <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
                <p>In the end, I was juggling with five courses, which I think I did fine with. It did take a toll on my sleep schedule, but I’m not sure if this is because of coursework, or because all my friends sleep late and I value social interaction.</p>
                <p>It was a chaotic freshman fall. Glad it’s over, but I’m more glad it happened.</p>
