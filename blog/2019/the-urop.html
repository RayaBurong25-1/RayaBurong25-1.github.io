                <p>This one would be a relatively short one.</p>
                <p>MIT provides us with very flexible research opportunities called in a program called UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program). Any student at MIT could join a research team to gain experiences about research in a particular field any term. There are official listings up in an official website that you could contact and get recruited if you have the prerequisites, however students could literally go up to any professor or researcher and ask them if there is any project to join or help with - it doesn't even have to be a professor in your course! The latter choice usually has more flexibility as you don’t need to have a lot of existing skills, and the professor will open it up for you to choose what to do. UROPs can be done any term, from fall, IAP, spring and summer, and students are paid a good $13 per hour and we are the ones controlling how many hours to work in a week, usually about eight to ten. Depending on the department and project, students might work in a lab or on their own (stuff that has to do with computers are usually not in a lab and thus very free in terms of when to work on the project – find some free time and try to work the intended number of hours).</p>
                <p>For this past term, I found some projects on the UROP listing (<a href="https://urop.guide">urop.guide</a>), and emailed the projects’ lead attaching my resume and adding how I’m interested plus my skills. Out of those, I was accepted to some to come speak in person for “interview” which is more like just talking in person to see what the project is like and if I’m still interested. In the end, I selected a project that is based in course 9: brain and cognitive sciences, but the project has quite a bit of python programming. The project lead for my favorite project to work with, which is part of the Media Lab, wasn’t in town during the proposal period.</p>
                <p>I did a project with a newly graduated student who was now a researcher, <span class="highlight">vboyce</span>. The project is A-Maze, a tool to help with analyzing incremental processing, i.e. what our brain does when reading a string of words in a sentence, especially how long we stop to process each word. This project is interesting because it touches on course 6, course 24 and course 9! The selected state-of-the-art methods of analyzing incremental processing difficulty are:</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px">1.	Eye tracking, which is very straightforward but is very expensive in setting up. The screen displays the whole sentence and a subject reads it. The method provides quite accurate results of how long we stare at a word to process it before moving on to the next.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px">2.	Maze, which is less expensive in setting up but requires manual labor. The screen displays two words at a time on two sides of the screen, one “correct” word that joins the sentence well and one “distractor” word that doesn’t make sense if it joins the already existing sentence. The subject has to process the words and select the “correct” word in order to get to the next word in the sentence. This method is moderately accurate as well, but is hard only because people need to generate “distractor” words.</p>
                <p>The project I’m under aims to automate the Maze distractor process, using machine learning methods. Experiments usually have sentence come in pairs, so that one is a control and another contains something we want to study.</p>
                <p>Because of my laziness, I would copy part of my proposal down here and edit it slightly...</p>

                    <h3>Personal Role and Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>During the first period of the project I refactored the code of the project to make it more organized, optimized and elegant. When that was done, I added some features to the tool and provide some more flexibility to their parameters, for example manual matching of words in sentence pairs. Once the tool is updated and deployed, it will be used in experiments and when that happens, I will shift my responsibility to learning how to analyze the data from the experiments.</p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>The goal of project this semester is to refactor the project code so that it could perform more functions, become more flexible, more elegant, and more user friendly, as the tool is intended to be deployed for linguists who might not have a strong background in coding. My personal goals are to be able to deploy a new, polished version of the code for the tool and get to use the updated tool on experiments where I could analyze the data.</p>

                <p>Overall, I was very content with my urop this term. I meet with my supervisor once a week, detailed what my progress was and got directions as to what I should do next. I gathered the free time I had, and put in an average of about 6-8 hours a week on coding, reading research and learning R (not as much as I thought ideal, but I was still adjusting to the university.) I became more confident with my python along the way as well. Quite a bit of progress had been made, and I’m looking forward to continuing the project for IAP!</p>
