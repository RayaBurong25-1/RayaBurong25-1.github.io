            <p>The night of August 16<sup>th</sup> was the last I was in Thailand for the summer break. Throughout summer I had been studying for ASEs (especially for 5.111 and 7.012 as they weren’t my strongest subjects), meeting up with friends and teachers, visiting schools and going on vacations. It had been a pretty fun summer, and I’m getting excited for MIT to start.</p>
            <p><b>It’s fricking Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</b></p>
            <p>At the same time, I was also quite a bit nervous and worried, just like any high school graduate going into college. Will I have friends? Will I get to do the activities I like? Will I have time to do work, or too much time on my hands? I remember saying this as early as just before graduation from Exeter, while I was getting a haircut downtown.</p>
            <p>My dad was recovering from his illness, and insisted that he drove us to the airport that night. The family was quite a bit worried, as he didn’t seem full of energy, and his physical abilities didn’t seem to be 100%. We offered alternatives, like a taxi, but he stood ground. So, at around 10pm, I loaded my two luggage into the car (yeah, this would probably be the last time I bring both my luggage bags back home), and my dad drove my mom and I to the airport. My brother stayed home that night, but we said our goodbyes at the front porch.</p>
            <p>It was a relatively peaceful drive on the motorway to the airport. I checked in with Emirates for the flight from Bangkok, through Dubai, to London (hehe roundtrip tickets means I get one day to roam around in London), and, after bidding adieu to my parents, I went off to the gates. Since we didn’t want my dad to drive very late at night, we pushed the drive earlier which means I have more hours to kill at the airport. By the time I went to the gate, it was still being used for the flight that would take off before mine, at 1am.</p>
            <p>I sat and tried to nap to pass some two hours. Unfortunately, an airport’s an airport, and silence cannot be expected at any moment of the day at all. I got up on the plane to Dubai, transited at Dubai for some two hours, and went on the plane to London. Nothing interesting on the flights – just me trying to garner as much sleep as I could.</p>
            <p>Contrary to what I said about planning for a trip in <a href="the-england-trip.html" class="highlight">[002]</a>, this one I actually intricately plan out what I would do – down to how many pounds I would spend on things. It would just be a halftime break for my flights, sleeping in the same hostel as the one I slept in my first time, taking the train to and from the airport, eating at this particularly cheap Chinese restaurant in South Kensington (what I love is that the price on the menu is actually what you pay, not like the United States where you need to add tax then tip as well). The stay was rather uneventful, as planned, and the only thing that was interesting was that I got to meet some Thai Scholars who are coming to study in the United Kingdom, including one that I knew back in Mahidol. What a coincidence!</p>
            <p>The next day I flew from London Heathrow to Boston. This whole journey is interesting because I’m probably the first of TS61 x MIT to depart from Bangkok, but the last to arrive. I landed at Boston Logan airport around 10pm Sunday, and waited for my luggage for quite a while. Just as I was walking out, one of the customs personnel gazed at me and directed me to come in a room to search my luggage. She asked about my two bubble-wrapped bottles of sauces – I was like, “it’s... sauce?” and wasn’t really able to explain what exactly the sauce contained. My passport was looked through, and she spotted an Iranian stamp within there. A moment of silence for all those (like me) who has no ties with Iran except going there for one visit for a competition and got questioned every time I go cross borders. Eventually, an hour after I landed, I finally got let out, hopefully without getting on the FBI wanted list or something.</p>
            <p>I hopped on the silver line, had some difficulty with carrying two luggage bags around and a very confusing elevator at South Station, transferred to the red line, and dragged my bags from Kendall to MacGregor House. The journey took about an hour and some twenty minutes of walking and workout, so we’re talking well past midnight at this point. Since it’s past midnight, I had to call campus safety to let me into the dormitory that I will be in. Now I didn’t have an ID card yet, and I’m new to the place, so it took me a while to realize that I should be waiting in the lobby (and call to get in) in order for the person with the keys to be able to let me into my room. The dorm rooms, for safety, has an autolock feature that is on my default. Cool. I was placed in J3 along with <span class="highlight">talkon</span> and <span class="highlight">taisf</span>, which is predictable as we all came really really early and MIT probably wants us to be in a comfort zone by placing people from the same country together for the time being. We all got lotteried into MacGregor as they are our top choice – back in summer pre-frosh had to rank dorms and an algorithm placed us into dorms, minimizing the total rank value, I guess. I explored the suite, the kitchen, the lounge and the bathroom. I prepared to take a shower.</p>
            <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
            <p>I locked myself out of my room.</p>
            <p>Uh.</p>
            <p>I had to go back down from the low-rise, call to get into the lobby, ask for the keys again, and got weird looks. The front desk also asked for an MIT ID, which I didn’t have, so they asked for any ID, which I didn’t have either because I was preparing to take a shower goddammit.</p>
            <p>Add 2 to the number of times I got locked out of my room. At the moment of writing, the counter stands at 3 – unfortunately beating <span class="highlight">darrenl</span>.</p>
            <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
            <p>I came to MIT at a very early date. MIT’s classes started September 4<sup>th</sup>, and I came on the night of August 18<sup>th</sup>, which makes me believe that this university has one of the longest pre-class periods. There was <span class="highlight">orientation</span>, <span class="highlight">FYRE</span> (first-year residential exchange), <span class="highlight">REX</span> (residence exploration), <span class="highlight">rush</span> (to fraternities, sororities and independent living groups – FSILG) and <span class="highlight">registration</span> before classes, and before that was <span class="highlight">FPOP</span> (first-year pre-orientation program), and before that there was <span class="highlight">ISO</span> (international student orientation). Yes, MIT loves its <span class="highlight">ACRONYMS</span> (Acronyms that Cunningly Replaces Ordinary Names with Yeet! MIT-Sounding jargon!)</p>
            <p>The ISO went fine and it was the more informational part of the pre-class period. There were a lot of things to digest, especially VISAs and I9 and taxes, which made me wonder why there is such a leap in responsibility once people go up to college even though they only age a year from senior year of high school. I made some international friends as well, some of which remained friends up until now – others I haven’t really seen or maintained friendship since, which I’m a bit sad about but it’s the way it is. Some of the friends made were the southeast Asians, who all shat on the region. I’d say that most of these international people have been to an Olympiad before, putting us on the more nerdy part of the spectrum of all MIT students. At least, what I got from here was that I became less worried about making friends, as it was proven to be as easy as just saying hi to people with some commonalities (or lack of, doesn’t matter.), but I became a bit more worried about paperwork. It was also during this time that we were introduced to UROP, MITFCU and some other random MIT facilities.</p>
            <p>I left the ISO early because FPOP was starting. FPOP is divided into many disciplines, about 30 people each, mainly by course, for example DEE is Discover Electrical Engineering, the one I’m in. There are also some other ones which are focused on leadership (FLP, first-year leadership program, for example) and art (FAP, freshman arts program). Honestly, I’m not sure whether these Fs stand for first-year or freshman, but that’s not quite the point. DEE started with a movie night where some played Cards Against Humanity, then the whole group watched Deadpool and chatted a bit. This hit me hard, not because of the movie, but because I have now met a sample of normal American MIT students, and it kinda shocked me. For one, for those Thai Scholars who heard about MIT students being nerdy, stop that thought. We are the nerdy ones – those people I met that evening are far less nerdy than Thai Scholars are. This brings me back to prep school days almost – much too quickly. I had to switch back my “prep school” mode again, and I learnt I was a bit out of touch in terms of popular culture. Don’t get me wrong, these people are nice and very open to new friends (it is the friending period, one where we missed going straight into senior year of prep school). I found myself speaking less than an average person in DEE, which made me a bit self-aware.</p>
            <p>DEE was quite fun. Over the course of 4 days, we learnt to solder, we visited labs within MIT, we listened to real MIT professors talk about what they are researching about and what classes they teach are about, we went around Boston to visit some museums and eat some meals, we got a taste of the 6.002 exam, and most importantly, we got quite close together. I retained quite several friendships from DEE, some people I still talk to now, some that I say hi when we pass by, but unfortunately for some, we became strangers again.</p>
            <p>Orientation period rolled around, and there were many things going on at once. There was REX, which honestly was quite like CPW again, then there’s the actual orientation events, which are somewhat informative but also skippable. We divided into colors and further into groups of about 10-ish, by advising group. Now this is the real deal – these groups are a taste of what MIT pre-frosh are actually like, not some kind of subset. The orientation leaders did not do a good job of making us know one another, so I rarely made friends during orientation, save for a couple not in my advising seminar and those in my advising seminar that I see every week. Activities would include, “what are GIRs,” “the sex talk,” the academic expo (recommended for free stuff and information about majors), the activities midway (even strongly recommended for discovering what clubs there are here), and meals. This week features an abundance of free food, so if you are spending, you’re doing it wrong. There is also ASE exams in the mornings (free breakfast! honestly, my opinion is that there is nothing to lose and in the best-case scenario, you can skip GIRs – for free). It was also during this time that people can fill a form to change dorms, in the case where you don’t feel like you belong in the dorms you selected. Did I mention that every dorm will have free food and lots of random activities to promote mingling among pre-frosh, and between pre-frosh and upperclassmen as well?</p>
            <p>For MacGregor, we had an evening where we visit the 9 subdivisions of the dorm (yes, subculture), have 10 minutes to explore, talk and find out about the culture in each entry, and rank them by preference so that a linear programming (according to <span class="highlight">alcheng</span>) algorithm can put people into their favorite entries. For example, A entry parties really loudly, so does D but a bit less loud, B eats sushi and party sometimes, while C is extremely silent, J likes memes and are omnipresent (looking at you, J3), G likes baking and music and are relatively reserved, H is looking to be very close to G and are the maker type, E enjoys being homey and inside and F pretends they are a frat. From the algorithm, I was put in G, taisf in E and talkon in J. Moving in time is the start of a new friend-making frenzy. It was around then that I came to know <span class="highlight">annasun</span>, <span class="highlight">darrenl</span> and <span class="highlight">stangs</span> – they met each other before during CPW, but they all live in G/H entries so it was inevitable for me to know them. Your living community influences the friends you’ll have so much, that’s why MIT puts the extra effort to make sure people find their most comfortable living subdivision – a feat I’ve yet to see elsewhere.</p>
            <p>By September, orientation events died down and was replaced with rush events, looking for people that would sell their soul to fraternities and sororities through free food like lobster and burgers and strong persuasion. I enjoyed my occasional free food and down time, so I ended up not joining a frat – statistically 40% do. MIT frats and sororities are not your typical crazy SOTUS groups, but are generally just “people of pretty much the same gender living together in smaller groups, sharing the building for lower rent than MIT dorms, eating and drinking together and host weekly lit parties.” Don’t count on me for a description of frats, though. People usually get so many more friends during rush, and I did too, mostly through mutual friends.</p>
            <p>Lastly for the pre-class period was registration to classes. I generally went by front-loading a bunch of courses, way beyond the class limit, and then deciding which ones to retain and drop the rest later, since drop date is way further into the term (12<sup>th</sup> week) than add date (5<sup>th</sup> week). This has got to be the most lenient university in terms of add-drop.</p>
            <p>And so classes began.</p>
