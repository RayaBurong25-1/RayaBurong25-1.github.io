                <p>One of the things I value is opportunities outside the classroom. I was sent here to the US to come study, but is it worth it if I only stay in my room all day doing psets and not really taking advantage of what MIT has to offer? All my life I’ve been striving to find a balance between academics, social life, extracurriculars, sports, music, leisure and sleep. I used to have “The Four Pillars” of daily life, but by now it has since expanded to however many pillars I could think of.</p>
                <p>The first opportunity to get to experience MIT extracurriculars was during the Activities Midway, briefly mentioned in [003]. There was an almost identical event during CPW as well. The ice rink is packed with roughly two hundred club booths, and a stage showcasing tens of dance clubs. The environment is very exciting – the upperclassmen were excited to see the frosh and to share their interests to the new class. The frosh were as excited to find clubs they belong to. I, too, was finding my place.</p>
                <p>It was a bit sad that I had an ASE (7.012 I think) which overlapped with much of the event, so I only get to go to the ending parts. I looked at the list of clubs and had taisf and talkon try to sign up my name on them. The ones that I’m interested in include some really CS-heavy clubs like MIT MIC, Battlecode and SIPB, some student publications and newspapers like The Tech, our newspaper, and Technique, our yearbook (so that I could continue being involved in the student newspaper and yearbook as I wrote in my application XD), along with some other arts publications, some sport clubs like skydiving, some other academic clubs like HMMT, and some art clubs like calligraphy and origami, and organizations like SEALNet. Honestly, all of the clubs look so fun and I should have signed up for a l l the clubs, but I don’t want a hundred emails to flood my inbox daily.</p>
                <p>Now, the core of student organizations and clubs are very much like prep schools. You can show up however often you’d like and commit however much you want to the club. Some clubs have paid positions as well. At first, I went to most club meetings to gauge my interest, and in subsequent weeks I went back to the ones I liked most. Some clubs I only go for food even, for example UMA. In my defense, I have friends in the association so it justifies me going to eat a free dinner?</p>
                <p>n o n – m e a l  p l a n  l i f e</p>
                <p>First meetings for clubs really want to keep people interested, so for a while, in like the first couple of weeks, there was an abundance of boba served in club meetings as well as meals. They fade away as time goes on, except for a number of clubs that offer free meals every meeting throughout the term.</p>
                <p>As for myself, I had a period of club exploration as well, and settled on a club that I go to regularly, and a handful of others that I poke my head in from time to time. They are the following:</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2><i>The Tech</i></h2>
                    <p>I became part of the production team of <i>the Tech</i>, MIT’s oldest student-run newspaper. Most people do not know about production – it is the process of taking already-written articles and laying them out on paper, as well as putting in puzzles and advertisements. We are quite literally doing the bin-packing problem. There are some nuances such as keeping a uniform distance between content and advertisement, maintaining the font size and kerning, and aligning stuff to the grid so that it looks nice on paper. It is quite a tedious task, so the staff is paid some $12 per hour! Since <i>the Tech</i> is published weekly on Thursdays, prod (short for production, if it’s not obvious) works on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, after waiting for content and photos to come in. Tuesday nights are called “ads night” and are mainly for putting in ads, opinion articles, sports articles and fun pages, and decide the general layout of the week’s issue. This is usually done in two hours or so. Wednesday nights are called “issue night” and we put everything else in, make some finishing touches, hand it off to the copy editor and start a process of back-and-forth final changes, then call it a night and send the issue off for printing. This can take anywhere from four to six (seven?) hours, and our sleep time depends on it being finished. On Sunday, the team looks back at the week’s issue and spot mistakes.</p>
                    <p>Apart from prod, I also join the photographers who have their own schedule. On Sunday, events are listed and the team asks for a volunteer to cover each event. Photographers attend the said events, come back and upload photos onto a Google Form set up for the team. For every photo, a caption has to be written, which is the job of the person who took the photo as well. Photos usually roll in on Tuesdays and are passed on to prod. Some photography jobs are paid; however, most jobs are us going to on-campus events worthy of documentation.</p>
                    <p>This club fosters a strong sense of community, teaches a lot of InDesign skills, gives two free meals per week and pays! Strongly recommended.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>TSMIT</h2>
                    <p>This stands for Thai Students at MIT, and is a secret organization in a way that it is not open to the public to join. The main criterion is that one must be Thai (or half-Thai) to join the activities. Usually this club is pretty low-key, having a handful of events per semester. The year begins with a welcoming barbecue, with an introduction to all the Thai students currently studying at MIT, or have studied at MIT. Sometime during fall, TSMIT also organizes a hiking trip – this past fall we hiked Mt. Monadnock in NH, eating some Moo Ping and Pad Kaprao on the summit. Another event during the term is the TSMIT Biannual event, which is not organized every two years (biennial), but twice a year. We invite all Thai Students around universities in the Northeastern part of the US for a dinner gathering and some games to get to know each other and have fun. During Thanksgiving, we have our internal potluck as well.</p>
                    <p>The events of the club bring together Thai people, and I highly recommend befriending upperclassmen because they’d be a really great source of help whether it be academics, housing, activities, internship seeking, career opportunities, finding a significant other, and much more.</p>
                    <p>I do not intend to find a significant other in this club nor anywhere at the moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>Technique</h2>
                    <p>I’ve only been to a couple of meetings for Technique, the yearbook club of MIT. It is a pretty chill club that gives you a free lunch on a weekend and a chance to come chat or talk about anything photo or campus related. There is an archive of yearbooks going all the way back to the 50s (I think). Every member, upon going through staph training (yeah, I don’t know why they spell it this way), can roam around, claim a photography job from a listing that updates weekly, get front seat tickets, snap photos, might get paid, and upload photos onto the server. There is a chance that any of the photos will be included in the very image-heavy yearbook. Landscape photos are also welcome, in addition to event photos, which means someone like me also has a chance! The club occasionally runs some workshops such as lighting, photo editing using Lightroom, and the club runs a photo contest every month, open to all members of the university.</p>
                    <p>People are really chill here, and the commitment is however much you’d like. Definitely recommended. I do think I need to roam around more and start sending photos up the server!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>HMMT</h2>
                    <p>The Harvard-MIT Math Tournament is a biannual math contest for high school students featuring an individual round in algebra, geometry and combinatorics, a team round, and guts round that is very restricted on time – hence guts. There are many factions to the club, such as the problem setting side, the website and infrastructure side, the photography side, etc.</p>
                    <p>In February before coming to MIT, I had the honor to come to the competition, and did horribly because I have long retired from competitive math and shifted to competitive programming, but it was a good experience nonetheless. Here, I had been going to just a few meetings, like some test-solving sessions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>MIT MPC</h2>
                    <p>The Music Production Club covers things from DAWs to making a beat and mixing and mastering audio. It features a pizza from Domino’s every Wednesday night, and a good lecture series that help you build up your own tracks. The club organizes makeathons as well. I went to a couple of lectures, and it supplemented my 21M.080 quite well.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>MIT MIC</h2>
                    <p>MIT Machine Intelligence Community comprises of several factions: one educating eager students about machine learning with pytorch, another inviting speakers to present latest research in the field. The club also runs a hackathon-like event, if I recall correctly. I’ve been to one of the pytorch sessions and one of the presentations. The club is very informative and good for expanding machine learning knowledge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>SEALNet</h2>
                    <p>MIT’s Southeast Asian Leadership Network chapter aims to educate people about Southeast Asia, having occasional meetings and cooking sessions. It is lowkey an assembly of us Southeast Asians, talking about how we’re doing at MIT, among other topics that align with the organization as a whole. I got some friends from this club, which is pretty nice.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                    <p>Apart from the clubs that I have been to, here are some other events that are associated with a particular club that I joined as well.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">HackMIT: the school’s hackathon. I was part of a team of four that devised a crowd-sourced lecture video sharing platform with automatic captions and one-click caption editing. It took place over a weekend and was a great experience to learn some new stuff I never knew before and strengthen some web development skills.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">ESP Splash: the weekend before Thanksgiving, ESP hosted a huge event that attracts high school students to lectures by MIT students about anything fathomable from math, astronomy, language, to country music, making friends, lion dancing, the NYC subway, mind-reading, and so much more. I taught two classes, one on Thai language, history and culture, and another on linguistics. It was a fun event and I finally got to teach in a classroom after dreaming about it for so long!</p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">ADT showcase: a good friend cheers for his friends who are in the Asian Dance Team. A surprising portion of my friends are involved in ADT, so I got tickets to this past fall showcase. It was fun to see everyone on stage and I’m proud of my friends!</p>
                </div>
                <p>Extracurriculars cover every field one could imagine, and is a good opportunity to take advantage of life at university. There are so many more clubs I want to be involved in, so I’ll make sure I explore more in the coming semesters! Seriously, everyone, join clubs!</p>
