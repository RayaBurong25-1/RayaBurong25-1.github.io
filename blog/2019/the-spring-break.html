                <p>The spring break was one of the things of the year that I look back to fondly. It was a time of relaxation, free of college essays and school worries, and a time to explore, have fun, connect with friends, and have a great time.</p>
                <p>Exeter’s spring break starts before an average prep school by a week, and ends one week early as well. Since the Christmas program, several friends and I have been planning a trip to Florida. In fact, so many people wanted to go to Florida that we split into three houses, around ten each. The rest of TS61 either found a host family or went back to Thailand. I booked the flights for March 6nd and March 17th, but since the break starts on March 2nd, I have a few extra days to kill. I decided to ask for a host family for that short time period, making this break another hybrid break for me. The same was for fall break, where I stayed with TS61 friends in an Airbnb at Roxbury for a week, then went to stay with a day student host family for another week.</p>
                <p>My house planned a two-leg trip where we’d go to Orlando in the first week and Miami in the second week, which means that I wouldn’t be able to go to Miami. We started a long process of finding things to do and finding a place to stay. We had several calls to narrow down, argue against and for each choice, and mess around. We settled on a place in Orlando for March 8<sup>th</sup> through March 17<sup>th</sup>, and the small subset of us who would be arriving in Orlando on March 6th decided on another Airbnb for a couple nights before the rest arrive.</p>
                <p>I stayed with Mrs. Meyers, who picked me up from Somerville the day of the spring break. I stayed there for a few days, and she took me out to see Bohemian Rhapsody, to some meals, and let me stay home for the rest of the time. I was up in the bedroom mostly, browsing random stuff, thinking of some computer Olympiad problems, cooked, and played around with Mrs. Meyers’ cats and dogs. One night her parents came for dinner, and I got to chat with an Exeter alum, class of 40s! It was a great way to spend the beginning of the break.</p>
                <p>On March 6<sup>th</sup>, I packed and got a ride to Boston Logan Airport. I met up with <span class="highlight">jchudom</span> (well, she doesn’t have a Kerberos, but it has become quite a custom), <span class="highlight">mkkotch</span> and went up the flight together.</p>
                <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
                <p>Orlando, Florida. Upwards of fifteen degrees Celcius. The airport has plam trees in the interior, and the automatic doors open up to s u n s h i n e. An uber is called, we took the highway – the landscape looks lush g r e e n and eerily like Bangkok to the point where I could fool some people that I’m on Phetkasem Road. The three of us got into our Airbnb, a room in a host’s apartment in a complex in an area that looks like the suburbs of Bangkok (for example, Ratchapruek) that has villages upon villages upon apartment complexes. We threw our winter coats away, and went exploring in our T-shirts.</p>
                <p>God. it’s SO GREEN.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The first few days we scouted Orlando, found a mall complex, navigated the Lynx buses, reflect about our life decisions, bought some groceries and set off some fire alarms. On the 8<sup>th</sup>, after we moved to the new Airbnb which was now our own apartment complete with some 3 bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen, <span class="highlight">plapicht</span> flew to Orlando and met us at the Florida Mall, and on the 9<sup>th</sup>, <span class="highlight">jkhwanp</span> came in, dragging her luggage on one hand and holding boba on the other. We are populating, and the fun is growing exponentially! There were eight people in total – <span class="highlight">jtkunpi</span>, <span class="highlight">pngamla</span> and <span class="highlight">fnatsuk</span> came later.</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>At Home</h2>
                    <p>We surveyed the apartment complex area and discovered that, apart from a big lake, there was a supermarket and some stores nearby. This means we could buy groceries and cook at home to save some costs, and only occasionally go to restaurants! This is one of the highlights of the trip – cooking together. Sometimes <span class="highlight">jtkunpi</span> would be the pork-mincer, once he was responsible for cutting up garlic bread after it has been baked in the oven (have you seen a person who thinks a square bread slice should be cut on its side and not diagonally? that was hilarious). We simulated Masterchef (complete with “30 minutes left!”), we had a glove that talked, we played music, we posed as a family, and so on. I invented a formula for sukiyaki sauce using 4 parts chicken sauce : 4 parts ketchup : 3 parts Sriracha and lots and lots of garlic and cilantro! We were always proud of our meals after we completed them, and the whole experience was wholesome on a new level. There were quite a few days where we would bring homemade sandwiches to the park and eat them there – more savings!</p>
                    <p>About half of the days were spent inside, and we mostly gathered around the TV to watch YouTube, movies, Netflix and TV shows. I watched most of the classic GTH/GDH movies for the first time here, like SuckSeed, รถไฟฟ้ามาหานะเธอ, ATM Er Rak Error, I Fine..Thank You..Love You, etc. There was Bird Box, which I only watched for a bit, and there was also The Pianist, and Running Man, a Korean game show that jchudom is obsessed with and tried to get everyone addicted to. Fun stuff.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we must not look over the fact that this break coincides with many college decisions. We got to congratulate one another on our achievements.</p>

                    <h2>Universal Studios</h2>
                    <p>On March 11<sup>th</sup>, we woke up relatively early to beat the crowd at Universal Studios theme park. The park was a city that involved Harry Potter, Dr. Seuss, Spiderman, The Hulk and so much more together. We joined the long waiting lines, some as long as two hours, and we rode approximately a dozen contraptions, including those which have a 5-minute waiting time and is a very childish slow merry-go-round. Over the course of the say, we got really wet, we experienced 4D, we rode cars, we spun, we hid from <span class="highlight">mkkotch</span>, we drank Butterbeer. I got dizzy after riding the Hulk – one of the most challenging contraptions there is – and had to recover for quite a while, while other friends went on to play other dizzy contraptions. It turns out I’m not all that scared of rollercoasters, it’s just that my ears can’t handle it that much.</p>
                    <p>I feel that Universal Studios was trying to go for maximum fun and frenzy here, because there were a lot of absurd ones out here. Pretty cool.</p>

                    <h2>Disney World</h2>
                    <p>On March 13<sup>th</sup>, we headed to Disney World. After going through the security check, we got on a ferry that brought us to the magical castle of Disney. It was a dream-come-true for most of us, to actually see the castle. There was a ton of people there as well. We went on some “rollercoasters” that aren’t as nearly as exciting as the ones in Universal Studios, we strolled around the Disney village, we got to experience the animatronics like the Pirates of the Caribbean, we watched the parade, we ate dinner, we watched the fireworks show. Even though right after the fireworks there was unfortunately an unprecedented chilling event, the whole day was no less than magical, which I think was what Disney was aiming for. We got to see our childhood characters come to life – <span class="highlight">jtkunpi</span> got to hug Donald Duck, for example.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Aquatica</h2>
                    <p>The day after the next, the house prepared to get extremely wet. Slides! Pools! Wave simulators! Rides! Races! Vertical tubes that hype you up with heartbeat sound effects and turn your scream into an aaaaaaarblbblglbggblgg! There was one funny thing that happened which wasted one hour of our time there. All of us were taking a break from the more physically tiring rides and went to a lazy ride, a long pool path where you sit on or insert yourself into a swim ring and let it float around the path slowly. After a period of time we decided to exit. However, what we didn’t know was that there are two nearly-identical exits, and we split ourselves between exits. I was with two who came out of the exit where we put down our shoes, first thinking that there was only one exit. After some waiting and looking at the map, we discovered that there were two exits, and we thought that eventually the other group would need to come here anyway to get their shoes. My group searched for the other group for so long, but to no avail. After so long, the other group came. What happened was, they didn’t realize there were two exits and they thought they went out the correct exit and we were pulling a prank on them, taking their shoes! The other group were already on their way to another ride and had given up waiting for us. Who in their right mind would steal 5 pairs of shoes? How did they not realize that there were two exits for so long?</p>
                    <p>Overall, it was a fun, wet day.</p>

                    <h2>Sea World</h2>
                    <p>The very next day, the house went to Aquatica’s sibling, Sea World. The one is heavy with marine animals and roller coasters, and since I didn’t want to risk my ears again on the day before I fly back to Boston, I didn’t go up any. I went to see the aquarium, which later others went to as well. I did join the party in some drop rides, and the “life of a penguin” ride, for example. We watched a dolphin show as well. The day was pretty enjoyable, and it was nice to see all the animals. By this time of the trip, we were getting pretty exhausted by all the theme parks we went to – amassing upwards of $400. It was worth it though, at least we cleared Orlando from our bucket lists.</p>

                <p>The last thing I saw in Orlando was the wait time screen... in the fricking airport.</p>
