            <div>
                <p>Towards the end of IAP, I started choosing the classes which I want to take in spring. The true timeframe was somewhat iffy - I might have been planning for spring term since fall term. Thing is, I'm a very enthusiastic courseroader - throughout the year if any course sounds interesting I'd note it in my courseroad, and towards the start of each term I'd pick a number of those to fit into my schedule for the term. I enjoyed the balance of fall term's courses - some in course and a couple HASSes. I want that for spring as well.</p>
                <p>I ended up registering for five courses: 6.004, 6.036, 6.08, 21M.606 and 24.903. There were the real deal: it got me pretty excited even before classes started! The first couple weeks of the term was pure joy as I got to take classes that I love, even moreso than fall term.</p>
                <p>Here's a rundown of the courses and my review:</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>6.004: Computation Structures</h2>
                    <p>This is, essentially, how to build a computer from the bottom up! There are several modules, going all the way from transistors (yes, almost touching physics), combinational circuits, registers and pipelines, ALUs, RAM and caches, to the RISC-V processor, assembly language, semaphores and operating systems. The lectures and recitations are more theoretical, and the labs make it more tangible and practical. It's a pretty broad subject and it gives a great insight into what's going on inside the computers that we use every day. At the very least, I understand more when I open up Task Manager and look at the memory tab! Recommended for those who want to know the insides of computers, might be too much hardware for software peeps, and too much programming for hardware peeps.</p>
                    <p>There are biweekly labs which requires the use of Athena. Some labs are in assembly, others in minispec. There are some synthesis of circuits as well! Pretty fun. Might be even better if we get to do the circuits by hand. There are also three quizzes throughout the term and no finals. Attendance in recitation is mandatory. Another big plus is the transparency of grading - we know our scores throughout the term. Overall, workload is pretty moderate - things are pretty spread out and there is time.</p>
                    <p><b>How did 6.004 go online?</b> Lectures are taped, recitations went on Zoom, still mandatory, labs went on as usual (expect some more lag connecting to the Athena), the final project/design exercise was canceled. Office Hours were on Zoom, and the best of all, quizzes were on Dropbox, Gradescope AND Zoom. What a time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>6.036: Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>Probably the largest class ever on the first day. 26-100, our largest lecture wall, was packed full, and there was even an overflow room in 54-100 that livestreamed what was going on in 26-100. Crazy! Reasonable, given that Machine Learning is all the craze nowadays, extending to business people and non-computer science people. I figure that the later classes are less packed, probably because people go to lectures less (me included) or see that Machine Learning is too math and not a magical thing. Nonetheless, this course goes over perceptrons, linear regression, regularization, neural netoworks, CNN, reinforcement learning, RNN and some more. I like the organization of the class and the building up or material from the start to the end. Linear algebra very much needed in the class. Recommended, especially to see what ML really is about.</p>
                    <p>The schedule repeats weekly, and is a bit hectic. Before class lecture on Tuesday, there are short exercises, as "pre-tests", then after the lecture there is a lab with a nanoquiz, and for the weekend there is a long piece of homework. It's a bit much to get used to. The labs can be done in pairs or groups of three. Everything is on CAT-SOOP within MITx (the UI/UX is pretty horrible, please go with full CAT-SOOP or full MITx). The lecture notes are quite theoretical: expect a lot of matrixes, partial derivatives and gradients. The homework contains quite a lot of coding, from numpy to pytorch - it's quite nitpicky too.</p>
                    <p><b>How did 6.036 go online?</b> Not much changed as most of 6.036 is already on that CAT-SOOP within MITx. Labs went on Zoom. The midterm was canceled and the final was online - I've heard it was such a disaster for the server that it lasted for five hours. Oops.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>6.08: Embedded Systems</h2>
                    <p>I anticipated this one to be pure gold, and Joe delivers. I had the privilege to meet him during my FPOP way back in August - he did a lecture and our mentors went crazy over him. I knew that of all the introductory subjects 6.01, 6.02, 6.03 and 6.08, I have to take 6.08. The first lecture has 10-250 packed, and retention rate is quite high - the last lecture had a lot of people too. This class is heavy on the lab - we cover breadboards, Arduino and server, which means we get to write C++, Python and mess around with wires. The lectures are the more theoretical side, from binary to encoding, power and more. It's like a one-hour Joe Steinmeyer talk show, and everyone loves it. His enthusiasm, his humor, his chill. Probably the best introductory course to EECS.</p>
                    <p>The class has five hours of lab a week, some exercises to do throughout the week as well as design exercises (i.e. labs but in your own time). There is a midterm and a month-long final project with a team of four or five. It was a great bonding experience as well as a good exploration, designing and implementing a project on our own.</p>
                    <p><b>How did 6.08 go online?</b> We were fortunately towards the end of the labs and lectures anyway, so only the last couple labs went online (in fact they are already posted online before). The exercises and design exercises were already online. A couple lectures were taped. The final project meetings were hosted on Zoom. GitHub was the way to go.</p>

                    <h2>21M.606: Introduction to Stagecraft</h2>
                    <p>So at first I wanted to do Drawing for Designers. It had a lottery and I didn't get in. However, I browsed the catalog once again (I love looking through 4, 6, 21, 24 and a bit more) and saw that there's 21M.606, which is everything <i>behind the scenes</i> in theater! It had very good reviews and an MIT Admissions blog post mention as well. The course was at the westernmost place ever, all the way at W97, and not gonna lie, I was a bit scared the first time I was there. I was a course 6, and know next to nothing about theater, so I wasn't sure if I belonged there. I come to learn that everyone is - most of the people in the class weren't theater majors and are beginners in theater. We're all interested in learning and that's why we're here. The highlights of the course was that, apart from having to walk west and confuse people along dorm row, this course is very broad and hands on! We touched script analysis, designing the set, props, clothing, lights and sound, then went on to actually use scale rulers, hang lights, use band saws, and ride the scissor lift! There are extra practice hours where we had to help out the play of the semester, and it would have been so much fun. I personally have hung lights and assisted the stage managers before eviction. We would have built the entire set, sit in on rehearsals, go watch a play in Boston and more.</p>
                    <p>This is a 9 unit class but the bulk of the work would have been during April where we spend after hours assisting MIT MTA's play. The lectures are two hours long on Tuesdays and Thursday mornings. It is a great way to get into theater and learn what's outside of acting. It's a basis for other theater classes at MIT!</p>
                    <p><b>How did 21M.606 go online?</b> The class shifted very heavily into the theoretical side - the designing of what would have been. We have weekly Zoom meetings to present our weekly homework instead, and the assignments ranged from drawing our bedrooms to reenacting scenes from a play, focusing on the cues, lighting, set, props and sound.</p>

                    <h2>24.903: Language and Structure III: Semantics</h2>
                    <p>I'm continuing my journey of linguistics, as 24.900 last term left me in awe. The only linguistics course that fit in my schedule for spring is semantics and it's a nice aspect of linguistics to learn about. How do we determine the meaning of words and sentences? This takes in quite a lot of syntax, i.e. drawing a tree structure out of a sentence, as well as lambda function and some set theory math. It turns out, <i>every</i> is a word of type <i>(et)(et)et</i>, a function that binds with functions from entities to truth values to return a function that binds with functions from entities to truth values to return another function from entities to truth values. We also get to rearrange words around, wonder what <i>the</i> means and wondering how tenses convey meaning. Welp, that was a mouthful. Interesting for those into linguistics, but to be honest this wasn't the aspect of linguistics I'm most fascinated about. Overall it's still quite good though!</p>
                    <p>There are weekly psets and two lectures a week. Workload is moderate.</p>
                    <p><b>How did 24.903 go online?</b> Lectures went on Zoom. The psets were already on LMOD, and the final exam was changed from in an exam room to on your own time on LMOD as well.</p>

                    <h2>6.009 Lab Assistantship</h2>
                    <p>Yes, on top of 57 units I also worked as a 6.009 Lab Assistant, which means going to a weekly meeting about labs, working on the labs for the class one week before it's released to students, and helping out in office hours. We used Jitsi within CAT-SOOP for virtual office hours after our eviction.</p>
                    <p>I get to help people and it's really rewarding to me. I've always loved teaching and being able to actually debug other people's code or assist them in finding out about algorithms is the best. I (indirectly) got mentioned in a couple MIT Confessions as well, and I call that an accomplishment!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>18.06 ASE</h2>
                    <p>During IAP I also took the 18.06 ASE, which required you to finish a whole textbook of homework. There were like a dozen chapters, each containing some 3-4 sections and we are assigned to do any 4 problems at the end of each section. It is a good move, as someone who's determined enough to complete the homework would naturally be equipped with the 18.06 material for the exam, and it acts as a sieve of productivity as well. The exam was at the end of January, and given that we did all the homework it wasn't that hard.</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: this ASE is the only course in my whole year transcript to have a letter grade. I can use this to boast my GPA.</p>
                </div>
                <div align="center" class="section-break">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</div>
                <p>There you have it, a bit of a strange spring term with all these circumstances, but I pulled through. 57 units, plus approximately 10 hours a week for the LA. Technically, I was also continuing my fall term UROP, but it faded since I did not have enough time to do everything and had to let go of this one. In terms of things apart from the academics, I feel like this term I had a better time, balancing and such. I socialized more. I went to club meetings and helped out some events like HMMT. I became the assistant production editor of <i>The Tech</i> (a.k.a. AssEd), I hung out with more friends and spent more time cooking with my closest friends (could be another blog post!) as well as eating out (this too!) and so on. I met a bunch of TS62 who came to Boston regularly. The only things I didn't do well were exercising and sleep. I rarely exercised. My sleep didn't improve much, before or after the eviction. This one was my favorite term at MIT so far (I only had a sample size of two), and looking forward to more! Be right back, gonna wait for fall courses to be released then will be courseroading for quite a while.</p>
