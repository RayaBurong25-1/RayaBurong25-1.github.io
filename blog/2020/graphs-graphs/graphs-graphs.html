                <p>I made a quick python script to plot a graph that shows date on the x axis and some interval data on the y axis with custom coloring, in this case my location in 2019 and daily high-low temperatures each day, as well as a graph that shows some other miscellaneous information alongside it, in this case rain and snow. I manually queried each day on Dark Sky - this was before I knew how to scrape. Not a big project, or a project of significance, but I'm putting it here as evidence that I've done at, and as a landing page for <span class="highlight">tcpc</span>, a close friend who has a blog over <a href="https://aquablitz11.github.io/">here</a> who used my code to plot his (more chaotic) data.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This is what it looks like when I use my sleep cycle data on the script. Coloring is Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 of each year. There is some data missing.</p>
