                <p>Oh boy it's been quite a while since I've documented what's been going around in my life. My last life update post was for the first day of classes, and honestly before that I haven't been posting updates either - those other blog posts were more just me coding some random stuff. The most obvious thing that's been going around that affected everyone's life was the COVID-19 pandemic, which I wrote a bit about its disruption on my spring term <a href="days-at-home.html">here</a>. Alright, here goes:</p>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>Daily Life</h2>
                    <p>My daily life has not changed much from week to week this fall... or since summer. Well actually spring. Let's just say since COVID happened, there has been minimal changes to my day to day life. It's been the longest that I'm almost entirely at home, pretty much since before kindergarten because from kindergarten onwards, summer break only lasts three months at most. It's been some 8 months since I'm back which has been so long but also kinda short.</p>
                    <p>I wake up usually sometime between 8am and 10am. There was a couple months where I set an alarm clock at 8am for self-discipline and strong recommendation from my parents, and I'd get to walk in the park nearby with them on some days too. My breakfast period gets pretty long, not only because I eat breakfast with my parents and talk about things, but also because it's the only time of day I allow myself to check Facebook and Instagram (it also used to be at night but since I wasn't as constricted by time at night I often slip and spend hours upon hours on it). Naturally, while I was asleep, a lot of my friends would chat and a lot of people would send emails so I have to catch up on up to hundreds of messages and emails every morning.</p>
                    <p>It is now about 11am and I go shower. This could actually be as early as 10:30am or as late at 1pm, and the timing of this sometimes gets moved around because of some "nightly" zoom calls and commitments. It's also around this time where I watch some YouTube videos, sometimes TapL, sometimes random Among Us compilations, other times just other channels I'm subscribed to or random front page videos.</p>
                    <p>My schedule doesn't look so productive and sometimes I bash myself for it - up to five hours after I wake up and nothing of substance is done yet. However, I think this is contrasted with the rest of the day.</p>
                    <p>After I shower, I get ready and sit at my work desk. At this point, I might get derailed and watch even more Youtube - back in summer I watched Taskmaster, a UK TV show, every week or so. If I'm feeling productive or if deadlines are near, I sit at my work desk and start doing through some lectures or psets right away. I fully clear and archive my emails this time, replying if needed (this might be why people see me replying at their 2am).</p>
                    <p>I eat a pretty late lunch at home, about 2-3pm, and the 1-4 hours I have after I shower is allocated for lectures and psets. After lunch? More time for lectures and psets. I sit on my work desk continuously for a couple hours, get up, walk downstairs, and continue for a couple hours more. Repeat until the day is done.</p>
                    <p>It's been quite a challenge to make sure dinner gets eaten around my other commitments. Ever since daylight saving time ended, every lecture / recitation /office hours shifted forward for me by an hour and threw everything off. I have mandatory office hours for 6.031 Monday to Wednesday and it's really really tricky to not make it coincide with when my family has dinner. I have 6.003 recitation Tuesday and Thursday and... I'll let the schedule speak for itself.</p>

                    <p>Now I'm guilty for taking 6 classes because I thought being home would cut some commute time and such, but this is generally not recommended. Please don't do this again.</p>
                    <p>I do my psets sometimes up until midnight, sometimes my estimations go wrong and that turns out to be 4am instead (looking at you, 6.031 - your psets are not Easy To Understand). Each class takes up quite substantial amount of time, and I'll post some data after the term's over.</p>
                    <p>I feel like I'm squished between two time zones, one at my home (Indochina Time, UTC+7) and another at MIT (Eastern Time, was UTC-4 but is now UTC-5). This creates a lot of situations where I can't make time for my family, or I can't make time for my friends. Some people living in Thailand chose to disregard their home timezone entirely and sleep at line noon or some very strange hour, but I physically and mentally not able to do so.</p>
                    <p>Weekends... I occasionally go out once a week, usually on Sunday afternoon, to play some badminton with some other US university friends who are stuck in Thailand, or to just have a day out. My house is somewhat in the suburbs, so commute takes a long time and this is mildly infuriating.</p>
