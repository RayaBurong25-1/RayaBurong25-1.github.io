                <p>Yesterday was day 2 of self quarantine in my house back in Bangkok. To summarize my situation as quickly as possible: Coronavirus. MIT closes. Chaos. I yeet home.</p>
                <p>Things get pretty boring pretty quickly when you have so much time to do but you're stuck in one corner of the house. Yesterday afternoon, I went exploring on Wikipedia (I know, sounds like a boring pasttime, but I assure you, there's not much more to do as classes have not resumed yet). I was on a voice call earlier with <span class="highlight">talkon</span> and we touched upon Old Thai and how Thai used to have three tones and more consonant sounds but later the consonants merged and the tones split. Fascinating. Something like an hour later, and I found myself going back to my ancestral roots and looking up Wikipedia articles about the Teochew dialect and the Teochew people. During that period of time I even saved Chaozhou into my "Want To Go" list on Google Maps (did you know Google Maps' map information in China is inaccurate because of some goverment shenanigans?). One thing I found quite interesting from all this Wikipedia-ing is the fact that oyster omelette is a Teochew cuisine. I have been assuming for much of my life that oyster omelette (or as Thai people call it Hoi Tod, literally fried oyster) is Thai. It's even an unofficial dual to Pad Thai, a dish that screams Thai (actually it screams Plaek Phibunsongkhram, because legend has it that he invented it with the intention of making people eat less rice as the country's going through some shortage).</p>
                <p>I'm sorry, when I write blogs like these I like to go off tangents that I find interesting. It's under the random subsection for a reason.</p>
                <p>What really got me was that this Teochew dish made its way to become a dual of a creation by a Thai field marshall who despises Chinese people. Let that sink in for a bit.</p>
                <p>I really do want to know how this came to be.</p>
                <p>Aside from that discovery, I dove deeper down into Teochew and initiated a plan to learn some more of my grandparents' mother tongue. One's heritage is quite a big part of one's identity and it only makes sense for one to cherish it.</p>
