                <p>Hello and welcome to a new section of my blog: feels. There have been topics that I wanted to write about, and might want to share with some people, but not necessarily everyone that I know. Facebook is not a great way to do that, and my random section of my blog doesn't do justice either. Feels would be sporadic. Things will be less organized (as if random wasn't disorganized enough). Most of all, these are unlisted. If you see are reading this now, chances are I've personally shared the link to you, since this is not reachable from any other part of the website. Unless my website has flaws, which is pretty likely.</p>
                <p align="center" class="u-gray-text">*&emsp;*&emsp;*</p>
                <p>This one's a jumbled mess of thought surrounding friends.</p>
                <h2>Groups</h2>
                <p>Pretty much most of my grade school life, I have never been part of any friend group. You know those pictures of people with their close friends in school as a cover photo on Facebook and stuff like that? Yeah, I don't think I was ever a part of any. I think it's quite prevalent in Thai youth that people have their friend groups who they are close to, talk to all the time, go out together and all that. It's a bit different from the US where's there's a higher degree of individualism, and that our society operates in a slightly different way. Here's how the former ruined my esteem a little.</p>
                <p>See when I think of people who I'm close to, talk to all the time and go out with, I can picture a bunch, but then another thought always smacks me in the face. People who I'm close to in grade school have their <i>own</i> friend group, and I'm usually just a tangent, or a floating body somewhat off the coast. In my last three years of high school, I was in a class of 24. It became grouped pretty quickly, and this reflects, in groupwork. I was always put in the "remainder of the class" group. I'm a free real estate. Some people might want to have me in my group because of my academics, but they'd obviously prefer their closer friends over me anytime. It was this "remainder of the class" that I came to be associated with. We sigh at the sight of other people in the class automatically grouping up, and we ourselves aren't that close to each other.</p>
                <p>I tried remedying this as I went on to grade 11. Between grades, our classroom retains the same members. One relationship between me and another person in the "remainder of the class" became pretty bad (a story for another day perhaps), and I felt like I should be with people who I feel comfortable with. I don't know if gender played a role in this, but I felt more in line with the girls in the class. Most of them were in the same friend group, so I orbited closer towards them. These people are thankfully very welcoming, but it seems they don't see me as part of their group, just someone who's "defected" or "a good kind friend." Skipping ahead to the last day of high school, I remember some that say they consider me as part of their group. I do think I'm still just a tangent though, judging from how they have their own groupchat that I was never invited to because "there's a lot of girl talk in there," they mostly talk amongst themselves and other things I observe. Yes sometimes after lunch they call me to walk to class together, but sometimes that doesn't happen. Am I thinking too much? Probably.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure myself why I wanted to be in a friend group. It must be some kind of warmness, or a sense of belonging. But this also kinda conflicts with my individualism, somewhat.</p>
                <p>Yeah when it comes to some things friend groups do, I mostly have to actively initiate that. "Do you guys wanna go out?" is one of the sentences I'm too familiar with. Sometimes they might ask me if I want to go out with them too, but I feel the former is more frequent.</p>
                <p>A couple years down the road I still talk to them and try to maintain connection, which I'm really grateful for. These friends have long gone into their medical studies, and are too busy to be social.</p>
                <p>Going back further, it is also the case back in junior high. I had people that I feel are close, but I don't know if they consider my a close friend or one of theirs. I float around. Primary school there wasn't much going on in terms of social life, but some memories that I still retain strongly was that I was bullied, made fun of and was a subject of jealously. There are those "sporty" people and there is me, a short unatheletic person. And you know how toxic primary school is. It's kids, I know, but it plants a deep root.</p>
                <p>Coming to study in the United States this thing has turned out for the better. One is that people are more individualistic, so there's as much of that norm. Another is that I may have found several I belong to.</p>
                <p>Alas, when I'm back in Thailand I can't help but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU">think about things</a>.</p>
                <h2>Nerd</h2>
                <p>I additionally sigh at how people look at me more as an academic being rather than a normal human being friend. It shows in how some address me - people say เทพอรัน (God Arun), jokingly, and I never like it. Don't elevate me. Apart from the glorifying names, quite a lot of people have been telling me that I'm "hard to reach" as a friend. What is that? I do not know. Some others have also commented in the past that "oh you're smart, and I didn't expect you to be social." Yes, I have a life and want friends too. This might be, in some part, affecting how I go about my days a few years ago. In grade 10 I was pretty close to the books, to be truly honest. I knew that contributed to those names. I socialized more in the years since, and by now I might have gone a bit far. Nonetheless, my efforts seem to be somewhat useless - those names stick, the stereotype hovers, and people still say I'm quite unreachable. I tried. Is it you guys putting a barrier onto yourselves thinking that since I'm on the academic side, I must be nerdy, hard to understand or talk to, and unreachable and thus wouldn't want to try to reach me? That mentality is strange. Am I thinking too much? Yes again. It's come to a point where I sometimes steer my actions to make it not seem "nerdy," like telling people to stop talking about academics. I just want people to see me as a normal human being.</p>
                <h2>Being Everyone's Friend</h2>
                <p>This might address some part of the friend group situation.</p>
                <h2>Selflessness</h2>
                <h2>Social Media</h2>
                <h2>Overall</h2>
                <p>I care too much about friendship. That is all.</p>
