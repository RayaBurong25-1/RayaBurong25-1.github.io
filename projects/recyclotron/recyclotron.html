                    <p>This project was done in a team of six, formed within the Phillips Exeter Academy chapter of <a href="https://launchx.com/">LaunchX</a> club:</p>

                    <h2>What</h2>
                    <p>This project was thought of as part of the student entrepreneurship club LaunchX, to invent a product that would help solve the world's problems. It was sent to LaunchX's Global Pitch event, and advanced to the final round. It was presented at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well. The project is an automatically sorting recycling bin, with camera and a classifier powered by machine learning, and motors to put the items into its corresponding compartment.</p>

                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>With climate change becoming one of the world's pressing problems, recycling is becoming one of the more significant ways of life to help combat climate change as well. The problem is, recycling doesn't seem to be intuitive enough and there is not enough incentive for people to both with the "hassle". Thus, Recyclotron is born. There are two main parts of the contraption. First, the machine, which would automatically classify recyclable items, and would display a redeemable QR code. Second, the application, which could redeem the QR code to collect coins or use as a coupon with partner companies.</p>

                    <h2>How</h2>
                    <p>The machine was powered by a Raspberry Pi and its operation code is written in <span class="highlight">C++</span>. The application, which I only had time to write a proof-of-concept, was coded in <span class="highlight">Java (Android)</span>.</p>
