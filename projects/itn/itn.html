                    <p>Improve the News is a project initiated by MIT professor Max Tegmark (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark">wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/">website</a>) and is helped realized by his 8 UROPs, namely:</p>

                        <li>Haimoshri Dali</li>

                    <h2>What</h2>
                    <p>Shamelessly copied from the website:</p>
                    <p><i>This is a news aggregator site developed by a group of researchers at MIT and elsewhere to give you control of your news consumption. Many news sites treat you and your attention as the product they sell to their advertisers, but this one is ad-free and eliminates cost through full automation. Just as it’s healthier to choose what you eat deliberately than impulsively, it’s more empowering to chose your news diet deliberately on this site than to randomly read what marketers and machine-learning algorithms elsewhere predict that you’ll impulsively click on. You can make these deliberate choices about topic, bias, style, etc. by adjusting sliders.</i></p>
                    <p>The summer project in general consists of many fronts to improve the Improve the News project - for instance one on the topic classification of news by machine learning, another on the mobile application implementation of the project, another on detecting topic bias or word bias of news articles, another on portrait bias presented in news articles, another on the use of opinionated words in news articles and another on data collection tools.</p>
                    <p>I was the leader and organizer of the topic classification front, dubbed Project C, as well as the sole developer for the Android application implementation of the project, and a developer for the data collection tools, also known as Project D.</p>

                    <p>This project was done with each person in their respective locations, as it was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <p class="highlight"><b>21 May 2020 - 28 August 2020 (3 months, 7 days)</b></p>
                    <p>The project spanned the summer of 2020, specifically beginning on the last week of May and ending the last week of August.</p>

                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>I joined the project because of two main reasons: one being that it is at the crossroads of two of my main interests computer science and linguistics, and the other being that I would like to work on a project that could have a positive impact on the world, and as we all consume news, if we can improve news, the world could end up in a better place than where we are now.</p>

                    <h2>How</h2>
                    <h3>Project C (Topic Classification)</h3>
                    <p>We come up with ideas for models to classify news articles using modern <span class="highlight">machine learning</span> and <span class="highlight">natural language processing</span> models, and used the New York Times Annotated Corpus as our benchmark for the accuracy of the models. I personally used <span class="highlight">Keras</span>, <span class="highlight">sklearn</span> and <span class="highlight">gensim</span> for implementing the models and run the models on MIT's Openmind cluster. Algorithms and models that I have worked on are Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, Naive Bayes, Linear Neural Networks, Doc2Vec, and an Ensemble Model that extracts features from several of our best performing models and run them through another Linear Neural Network. I also looked into several research papers including Doc2Vec and Yang et al. but haven't had the time to implement the latter.</p>
                    <h3>Project A (Android Application)</h3>
                    <p>The Android application is developed on <span class="highlight">Android Studio</span> using <span class="highlight">Java</span>. I receive feedback from the whole team daily, brainstorm the design, theme and colors with them as well as professional designers from Australia and New Zealand, and make changes accordingly. The app is currently only available for internal testing on the Google Play Store.</p>
                    <h3>Project D (Data Tools)</h3>
