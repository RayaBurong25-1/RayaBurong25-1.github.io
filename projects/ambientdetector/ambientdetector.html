                    <h2>What</h2>
                    <p>This project was part of the science project subject of Mahidol Wittiyanusorn school. We thought of a computer science project that has to do with assistive technology.</p>
                    <p>We are honored to have presented this project in Thailand's National Science Contest and won third place in the high school category. We also presented at the International Science Youth Forum 2017 in Singapore to Turing Award winner Barbara Liskov, and at i-Create 2017 in Kobe, Japan to HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.</p>

                    <h2>When</h2>

                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p><i>More than five hundred million people in the world have hearing problems, ranging from total deafness to minor hearing issues. Their daily lives are affected by their conditions, for instance not being able to hear door knocks or car horns – sounds that deserve attention. As a result, some hearing impaired people may be at risk of danger. Our project aimed to develop an application which assists people by detecting important sounds in distances of up to four meters.</i></p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>How</h2>
                    <p><i>There are two modes to our application – "recognizing mode" for complete identification of sound, and "lite mode" for notifying users of loud sounds. The essential algorithm used in the recognizing mode is fast Fourier transform, which converts sound data from a time domain to a frequency domain. The resulting data is then compared to fingerprints stored in the phone. In addition to the default sounds we included as part of the application, users may add their own sound fingerprints. When tested in a real environment, the identification efficiency was 100.00% for noise rejection, 98.67% for single sound, and 60.33% for multiple sounds. The response time of the application is around 3.26 seconds, which is satisfactory.</i></p>
                    <p>The application was coded in <span class="highlight">Java (Android)</span>, with short time Fourier transform as the base algorithm, and a peak signal-to-noise ratio based algorithm presented in (In-Chul Yoo 2008) as the recognition algorithm.</p>
