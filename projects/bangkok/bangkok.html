                    <p>Me, born and raised in Bangkok suburbia</p>

                    <h2>What</h2>
                    <p>This is a project I came up as I travel around in Bangkok, or more accurate as I travel into Bangkok. Bangkok is growing at a very fast rate so I want to look back to the city's origins as well. A major influence to this project was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6U7YFPrz6Y">The New York City Evolution Animation</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Where</h2>
                    <p>This project was made mostly in my bedroom.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>When</h2>
                    <p class="highlight"><b>6 August 2020 - ongoing</b></p>
                    <p>This is a side hobby/project of mine, so it might take anywhere between a few months to a few years depending on the other things going on in my life.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>I haven't really seen one of these lying around on the internet so I figured I might as well make one for fun, for the expansion of my knowledge of Bangkok, and for the benefit of mankind if this ends up somewhere near publishable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="u-egg-back">
                    <h2>How</h2>
                    <p>I start by tiling screenshots from OpenStreetMap at a few zoom levels into <span class="highlight">Inkscape</span>. I search all over the internet, mainly starting from Wikipedia, compile some of my findings worthy of inclusion into the Inkscape project file. I line old maps to match the scale and location, and map positions and trace over routes. I plan to document my adventure in blog posts as well.</p>
